<h1>Son of Suckerfish Dropdowns</h1>
	
<h2>Tuesday 18 May, 2004 ( 8:47PM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p><img src="../images/dropdowns.gif" alt="A dropdown menu"> <a href="../../articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/index.html">Son of Suckerfish Dropdowns</a> is a new article from myself and <a href="http://www.danwebb.net/">Dan Webb</a>, explaining how to apply Suckerfish Dropdowns in a vastly improved way over the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dropdowns/">original article published in A List Apart</a>.</p>

<p>Essentially, a Suckerfish Dropdown is a dropdown menu built with CSS with a little bit of JavaScript bolted on to accommodate Internet Explorer, which doesn't support the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class on anything other than links.</p>

<p>The original method was already lightweight, accessible and cross-compatible, but this method is even more so. It now works with multiple-level dropdowns, the JavaScript that mimics the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class is just 12 lines long, to improve accessibility <code>display: none</code> is no longer used (alternatives may seem easy enough to find, but trust me, this was a real pain to sort out) and problems that were encountered with Opera and Safari browsers have been overcome.</p>

<p>If you can't be bothered with the article, just take a quick peek at the <a href="../../articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/example/index.html">baby at work</a>.<br>
 <br>
There have been a LOT of headaches trying to figure out the best way of doing this (mostly caused by Opera surprisingly enough), but we're quite confident that it's a damned good way of applying dropdown menus if you ever have the desire or need to do so and we can't think of a better way of doing it.</p>

<p>This article is part of a collection of seven Suckerfish articles, the rest of which will all be published in one go quite soon. So stay tuned.</p>

<p>Safari 1 seems to cope fine with the horizontal menus, but not your vertical one, where the submenus appear at the top of the window. (I'm using OmniWeb 5 beta as a way of testing Safari 1.0, since it uses that earlier web engine.) A fix to this would be brilliant. (Along with one for IE 5 Mac?)</p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment15"><span>Comment </span>15</a></h3>
<p>Thanks very much for the comments so far.</p>

<p>Neerav - I can't replicate the problem in IE5.0 - it works fine for me. I'm not sure about IE4, but I'm not sure it needs to be a serious practical consideration any more (besides,  regarding the wideness, this can obviously be controlled with CSS and if the only the top-level list displays then at least there should be a viable navigation option).</p>

<p>From what I understand, this works in Safari 1.2, but clearly not in Safari 1.0. I can't figure out why the problem of menus appearing at the top of the window should occur, but I'll attempt to look in to it (how would someonw without a Mac, let alone Safari 1.0 go about doing that...? If someone can figure out this problem, let me know).</p>

<p>As for IE Mac, does anyone use that? Exactly what's the problem? (If you come across browser compatibility niggles, please be as detailed in your explanation as possible so that we can try to work it out).</p>

<p>As for the PPK article that Dante points out - it's interesting. I haven't read it before. I could take up a lot of the criticisms laid out there, but the bottom line is that Suckerfish Dropdowns are CSS driven  with a pinch of JavaScript to simply mimic the :hover pseudo-class. It's a good practical option. The best as far as I'm (and others are) concerned.</p>

<p>Neerav, yes, I can replicate the IE 5.01 error and it is fixable with a little bit of box model hackage and minor CSS changes but really I'd like to make the point that the really meat of the article is the actual technique rather than our specific CSS implementations.  In practice people are going to have to write their own CSS implementations on a per project basis.  We are only giving you a clue as to how you might go about writing the CSS really.  We did however spend a fair amount of time getting the main horizontal menu CSS to work because we though it would be valuable.  The vertical menu really was just a quick example though.</p>

<p>On PPK's article,  he has got some interesting points (about IE no-script accessiblity) but really,  I wouldn't call it complicated at all essentially it's just a tiny little patch to help IE until it can support :hover properly.  No, it isn't seperating behaviour from presentation in the way PPK is decided is a good idea but practically Im not sure that this really matters.  Yes, he could write a menu that worked with JavaScript and had some kind of backup for no script browsers but fact is that it would end up more compilcated and much bigger in file size.</p>

<p>What Suckerfish is is a valid, extremely compact and practical method of implementing something that has traditionally been a pain to implement and while it would be nice to seperate out everything very neatly in practice Suckerfish is a nice little solution.</p>

<p>To address the IE 5 Mac problem - if you want to make it work in IE 5 Mac you need to switch over from using window.attachEvent() to using the old window.onload method so you would change:</p>

<p>if (window.attachEvent) window.attachEvent("onload", sfHover);</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>if (document.all&amp;&amp;document.getElementById) window.onload=sfHover;</p>

<p>That should get it going again...there are a few obvious disadvantages to this though so I'd advise against it unless you REALLY care about IE 5 Mac.  <br>

<p>For Safari, you could try wrapping the first levels in a relatively positioned div. I had a problem with a similar setup which uses  dynamically generated unordered lists up to five (! don't ask) levels deep and solved it by doing that. And, if I remember, I had to set the style in the tag, not the stylesheet for some reason. Now just have to get rid of the white space for IE. Anyone have a script for that?</p>

<p>How might I deal with putting each navigation item in a table cell? The moment I break the list and try to make 3 lists (3 primary navigation links) instead of the one ul, IE chokes and only displays the first dropdown. My design requires that each navigation menu live inside a table cell, but lists cannot span multiple table cells. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>The one thing I like about this approach is that Google likes it.  I don't think Google is going to grok just any old JavaScript DHTML dropdown menu implementation.  And if those menus are the only way to view content on your site (yeah, that's ANOTHER can of worms), then big chunks of your site could be invisible to search engine indexing.  Suckerfish menus don't have that problem.</p>

<p>Ok the original article saved me a lot of stress...to know how to achieve the effect without extensive scripting or markup.<br>
Now using CSS it comes easy, but my stress is coming back as i needed to make a menu ( similar to macromedia's but with CSS ) for a project.<br>
So i fired up the old suckerfish and in 5 minutes, i was working the way i wanted..........in firefox.<br>
20 minutes i had it working in IE 5+......not Opera.<br>
after almost an hour i decided to try the new suckefish tech, to slide out the second-level items ( left: -999em ) and <br>
i have ' my-almost-macromedia-without -the -flash -suckerfish -menus '.<br>
I feel that Browser support is really determined for what you &amp; you're client's target audience is. In my cae the target audience is people with a dsl or faster connection. So naturally i design for modern browsers .</p>

<p>The suckerfish is trully are unique tech, but as Dan has said-<br>
" We are only giving you a clue as to how you might go about writing the CSS " ,you really  have to find you're own solutions for what you're working on.</p>

<p>Has anyone developed a horizontal navigation using images that work with these dropdowns? I have an unordered list that has the parent links replaced with nice images in the CSS but it doesn't display the dropdowns. Any ideas?</p>

<p>How do you make the items that are "dropping down" (ONLY the "dropping down" items - not the top level) appear in a horizontal row rather than a vertical list?</p>

<p>Adding the following style did not do it:</p>

<p>#nav li ul li { <br>

<p>Wonderful menuing system but I cannot come up with a way to prevent the dropdown menus from hiding behind an iframe located just beneath. I've tried z-indexing in various ways, thought about automatically resizing the iframe but that's a bit cheesy...the dropdown menus "should" be able to show up on top of the iframe, yes?

<p>I don't know any js.  Could you explain the disadvantage of using the replacement script you propoposed:</p>

<p>if (document.all&amp;&amp;document.getElementById) window.onload=sfHover;</p>

<p>for Mac IE compatibility?  I'd like these folks to be able to view the lower level menu but was concerned by your statement above.  It seems to work fine in Win IE, NN, Safari, Firefox with this script (no chance to check with my Mac IE users yet).</p>

<p>I'm also bumbing up against a cascade issue with Win IE 6.  Styling the top level with {text-align: center;} has resulted in all of the lower level list dropping form the center rather than even with the left edge.  Perhaps I screwed something else up.  Things work fine in NN, Firefox, Safari 1.2. </p>

<p>Great work!  I look forward to the upcoming articles!!</p>

<p>Not working in Mac IE is the only thing that prevents me from using. Any idea why the original suckerfish works in Mac IE (), but this doesn't? Also maddening is the fact that Eric Meyer's CSS-Driven Drop-Down Menus from "More Eric Meyer on CSS" works in every browser I care about covering except Mac IE -- with no mention of the exception. Mac users are probably much quicker to move to good browsers, but I can't ignore Mac IE5.2.</p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment49"><span>Comment </span>49</a></h3>
<p>I have been fascinated by this topic, and have been keen to get the<br>
vertical menu (<br>
<a href="http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/example/vertical.html">http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/example/vertical.html</a><br>
) working on various Mac browsers.  Here are my comments/questions,<br>
and a summary of my findings.  WARNING:  I really don't have much idea<br>
what I'm talking about - I know little CSS and less Javascript, so<br>
please be gentle, but please do comment!  </p>

<p>Javascript</p>

<p>1)  Duplication:  The sfHover function is triggered even if the CSS<br>
    works.  I am not sure if this is a problem at the moment, but it<br>
    seems to me to be asking for trouble at some stage.  It would be<br>
    better to test for an IE browser (and hence a browser in which the<br>
    CSS does not work) and trigger the javascript only if one is<br>
    found.  If the browser is not IE, there is no need for the<br>
    javascript because (as far as I am aware) the CSS works on<br>
    everything else.  A good test for IE is to see if the document.all<br>
    property is supported.</p>

<p>2) Mac IE5:  As mentioned in earlier comments, window.attachEvent does<br>
   not work in IE for Mac - it is not implemented at all.  The best<br>
   (only?) way to deal with this is to use an onLoad event.  But this<br>
   may cause problems (see comment 17) - any earlier assignment to<br>
   window.onLoad will be overwritten, and javascript elsewhere on the<br>
   page may be broken.  Also, window.onLoad can be very slow (see<br>
   <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/05/26/addLoadEvent">http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/05/26/addLoadEvent</a> for comments).<br>
   The best solution therefore is (a) test for IE; (b) if not IE, no<br>
   need for any more javascript; (c) if IE, use window.attachEvent if<br>
   possible, else use window.onLoad, taking care not to clobber any<br>
   existing onLoad code.</p>

<p>Here is my suggestion:</p>

<p>if (document.all) { //MS IE <br>
   if (window.attachEvent)  window.attachEvent("onload", sfHover);<br>
   else { //IE 5.2 Mac does not  support attachEvent <br>
   	var old = window.onload; <br>
	window.onload = function() { if (old) old(); sfHover(); }<br>
	 } <br>
}</p>

<p>3) WebKit:  Safari 1.2 has no problems rendering the vertical menu<br>
   example, but browsers using earlier versions of WebKit such as<br>
   Safari 1.0 (used by OS X.2), OmniWeb (after 4.5, I think) and ?<br>
   Konqueror do not work.  It seems that the problem is caused in the<br>
   #nav li selector.  If 'position: relative' is removed, everything<br>
   seems to work fine.  I have absolutely no idea why this is.  So<br>
   this works in OmniWeb 4.5 and should work in Safari 1.0 and<br>
   Konqueror (I think - testers please!).  It doesn't seem to break<br>
   anything else though:</p>

<p>	#nav li { /* all list items */<br>
		/*position : relative;*/<br>
		float : left;<br>
		line-height : 1.25em;<br>
		margin-bottom : -1px;<br>
	        width: 11em;</p>

<p>4) That last comment was a lie.  The rendering of second level lists<br>
    in Safari 1.2 (used in Mac OSX.3) is thrown out slightly.  Some<br>
    borders disappear, and some remain when the menu has gone.  Adding<br>
    some right and bottom padding as follows cures the problem (and<br>
    this time really doesn't seem to break anything else):</p>

<p>	#nav li ul { /* second-level lists */<br>
		position : absolute;<br>
		left: -999em;<br>
		margin-left : 11.05em;<br>
		margin-top : -1.35em;<br>
                width:  11.05em;<br>
                padding-right: 0.5em;<br>
                padding-bottom: 0.5em;<br>
	}<br>
  <br>
5) I can't see what the point of the #nav li ul ul selector is, so I<br>
    deleted it.  Am I missing something?</p>

<p>6) Er, that's it.</p>

<p><br>
Here's the whole &lt;head&gt; tag from the vertical menu page (assuming that my post doesn't get mangled).</p>

<p>iframes and select menus...</p>

<p>As far as I know there are two ways to get around these showing through everything.</p>

<p>1. Hide them with javascript when you need to show something over the top.</p>

<p>2. You cover the iframe / select with another iframe behind the content you want to show... so in this case i guess you would have a  around your  then you have two layers positioned on top of each other within the . The top layer is the  and the layer underneath is an iframe that covers whatever is beneath it. (I found the idea on a website done in black and red and really hard to read can't rememeber the url.)</p>

<p>I used the iframe method in a prototype of a web app - and it did work perfectly - even though its a bit of nasty work around... I just created iframes on the fly whenever i needed them and then got rid of them. I haven't got the complete code anymore, but i managed to find this bit...</p>

<p>var xiframe<br>
var oiframe = ""<br>
function show_div(xdiv)<br>
	{<br>
		if(oiframe != "")<br>
			{<br>
			hide_div(oiframe);<br>

I am currently working on implementing your solution, but it doesn't seem to work under Mac 5.2. Unfortunately I am not able to test it myself (no macs around here), but what I hear from external testers, it doesn't seem to work on thei mac-boxes.</p>

<p>Linux: Galeaon and Mozilla works like a charm...</p>

<p>You're right.  It doesn't work on Mac IE5.2.  There is a different problem on Omniweb 5, which means there is probably also a problem on Safari 1.0 (ie OSX.2) and Konqueror.  It works fine on Safari 1.2</p>

<p>Well, I really don't know what I'm doing, but trial and error suggests the following:</p>

<p>1)  The IE problem is caused by the div#s-header .invisible selector.  If you remove it completely, or replace the display:none with something else, it all works fine.  I don't know why. </p>

<p>2)  The Omniweb problem is caused by the float:left in the #s-dropdown li selector.  If you remove the float:left, it works.</p>

<p>Hello, first, thank you, thank you, thank you for making such a great menu, am actually making it work. I'm sure the questions I have are in the stupid range, but I don't know and can't figure them out either due to age (older than dirt) or brain function (effects of multiple strokes). I am trying to redo a site I did for a non-profit organization as my contribution to their effort. The original site (my first attempt at doing this) is a mess, and is done in frames, etc. am trying to redo it in css, etc. and make it as great as I can.  I have uploaded the page to the url listed below in case anyone has time or the inclination to assist me.</p>

<p>My problems are:<br>
1. there is too much space between the logo area and the nav. bar, am sure it is something simple, but don't see it.</p>

<p>2. problems with the nav bar -<br>
 . if I resize the text thru the browser to larger or largest - it goes off the screen, is there a way to keep it the same size regardless of the text size used?<br>
. is there a way to center it?</p>

<p>3. under the "body-font" I have no idea what the "78%/1.5 means - help.</p>

<p>4. There are several style items I don't think I need, but am afraid to remove them as I am just learning all this, and right now it works - lol.<br>
  p#smurf<br>
  #smurf strong<br>
  h1<br>
  #scaffolding<br>
  #scoffolding a<br>
  #scaffolding a: hover</p>

<p>5) Is there a way to make the logo section and navigation bar "static" have read a lot and tried several things, but none of them seem to work correctly.</p>

<p>6) Could the styles be put on a separate page and use the @import statement?</p>

<p>I realize there is still a long way to go before I have this right, am going to remove the "Mission Statement" and put it on an intro page for one thing. Just thought it would be best to get one page correct, before adding all the rest.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any assistance, am sorry am not at the competence level most of you are, but am trying hard and learning as fast as I can. Marilynn</p>

<p>I have a possible solution for allowing the top level items of horizontal menus to be as wide as they want. I need to do this because my the text and links for my menus are generated from a database. Hope this is useful for others.</p>

<p>I found that if I removed the widths then the top level items would only use the space they needed IN NETSCAPE but would use the entire page in IE. However if the width is set to 1px for all top level LI items then IE will get it right and NETSCAPE will have them all sitting on top of each other. To get around this I added an extra line in the javascript that says, basically, that every top level LI item should have a width of 1px set on it - But only if the browser is IE. Seems to work in IE/pc, NS/pc, IE/mac (not completely briliant but good enough), NS/mac and Safari. Adding the "white-space:nowrap" forces the text to stay on the one line.</p>

<p>My ul list is structured so that every li item has a href that fills the availble space of the LI</p>

<p>First the javascript for setting up the menu needs to be altered:<br>
//--------------------------------------------<br>
sfHover = function() {<br>
  var BUA = navigator.userAgent;<br>
  var BIE = BUA.indexOf("MSIE");<br>
  var BIsIE = BIE&gt;=0;</p>

<p>  var sfEls = document.getElementById("mainNav").getElementsByTagName("LI");<br>
    for (var i=0; i&lt;sfEls.length; i++) {<br>
      sfEls[i].onmouseover=function() {this.className+=" sfhover";}<br>
      sfEls[i].onmouseout=function() {this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp(" sfhover\\b"), "");}<br>
		<br>
      //all is normal till here. If we're using IE then this tells any first level item to have a width of 1px<br>
      if (sfEls[i].parentNode == document.getElementById("mainNav") &amp;&amp; BIsIE) {<br>
        sfEls[i].style.width = '1px';<br>
      }<br>
   }<br>
}<br>
//------------------------------</p>

<p>These changes should occur in the style sheet</p>

<p>#mainNav a {<br>
   /* add these */<br>
    white-space:nowrap;  /* forces the text to stay to one line */<br>

<p>Thank you. This was a huge help! I've tested on Windows with Netscape7, IE6, Opera and all worked great. </p>

<p>I haven't seen anything mentioned about Netscape6 -- when i tested it, everything rendered correctly but the dropdowns didn't function. Is this a known issue? or just me? I would it would have been mentioned by now if others had troubles too.</p>

Styling the top-level menu:   Andrew mentioned above that he was having trouble centering the top-level buttons because it caused IE6 to drop the menus down from the center of their parent buttons instead of aligned to the left.</p>

<p>I had the same problem for several days as well.  Among other things, I found that removing the width: specifications for #nav li, and just leaving the with: specified in #nav a, fixed the problem in IE.  But, it also caused the menus to break in Opera; the main buttons stacked vertically instead of in a neat row.</p>

<p>I finally found a solution tonight:  apply the text-align: center to #nav a, not #nav li.  Solves the problem.</p>

<p>Now if I can just figure out why 2/3 of my menus are refusing to disappear on mouse-off in Mozilla and Firefox ...</p>

<p>Hey, Dan (#57)~<br>
A solution to parallel borders touching each other is to style three sides in the &lt;ul&gt; and the fourth side in the &lt;li&gt;. Example:<br>
ul {border: 1px solid black; border-bottom-style: none;}<br>
li {border-bottom: 1px solid black;}<br>
The &lt;ul&gt; becomes a shell that draws the top border and extends the left and right as far down as they need to. The &lt;li&gt; draws the bottom border for each menu list item, including the bottom of the shell.<br>

<p>Thanks for the article.<br>
I was wondering if there is a way to put the menus in a file external to the HTML files?<br>
With good CSS you can change the look of a whole site by changing just one or two files. With the menu implementation here you would have to edit EVERY HTML file in the site to make a change to the menu.<br>
Also, the entire menu system code is duplicated on every page. <br>
If it could be made external then site wide changes would be easy and HTML files would be smaller.</p>

<p>I have used a Javascript menu system and each HTML file calls up the javascript. I can change the menus on entire sites by editing a couple of files only. Could this be done with the Suckerfist type menu system?</p>

<p>Any comments?<br>

<p>There is a suggested fix on the alistapart discussion (page 18 I believe).  I tried it on that javascript but wasn't able to get it to work. So no luck there but  he does explain why the menus don't work in NN6.</p>

<p>"In the CSS dropdowns, s are styled as block elements whose dimensions occupy the entire  that contains them. Consequently, there is no  background to hover over, and nothing happens in Netscape 6."</p>

<p>I noticed this too since in my version the li is a pixel larger than the image i used so I would see the menu appear but only around the edges. </p>

<p>Referring to message #43 or so and onwards - not sure if this has been resolved yet? This was referring to issues with IE and others - as in menu items not "appearing" or disappearing. One solution is to "wrap" the menu code in a "box" like so:</p>

<p></p>

<p>   ...menu code...</p>

<p></p>

<p>the CSS part looks like so:<br>
div.lix {<br>
   position: absolute;<br>
   top: 33px;<br>
   padding: 0 10px 0 0; <br>
   z-index: 120;<br>
}</p>

<p>don't ask on the technicalities - I don't know. Adjust each of the elements in the above CSS block to suit your particular requirements. I've tried this in both horizontal and vertical menus and its done the job. Never had an issue with firefox and this solution fixed up issues I had with IE6. Don't have a MAC so cannot pass comment. Some else could try and then report back here. HTH</p>

<p>A great script,<br>
though there's still a lot of questions and troubles.<br>
... and I'm gone add one (or two):</p>

<p>My first script didn't work 100%. After that I tried the source code of the example page. It contained the same css but just in another order. So placing something like float: left; before or after another css command can make the difference between the submenu showing up or not!!!! (don't know what my old order was, but the example is good. and don't know if it was only IE -yack spit!- or mozilla firefox as well.)</p>

<p>But by changing the order I can't fix the following:<br>
I'm trying to add this to my second level lists (#nav  li ul) for IE6 (yack spit!):<br>
 background: white;<br>
 border: 1px solid gray;<br>
 filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=90);<br>

<p>Re #95: I whacked in alpha as a quick test too, with the same results. Not crucial so I dropped it again. It'd be pretty spiffy if it worked tho, I'd be most interested if anyone knows whats up with those 3rd level's dissapearing</p>

<p>I  have a client using Netscape Navigator 6 who didn't bother to tell me they were still using NN6.  Sure enough, the dropdowns that I put together for them based on this code doesn't work.  And of course, the client refuses to upgrade to a newer browser.</p>

<p>Found it! Or a workaround.<br>
(Thanx Dan, for trying to help me out.)<br>
Instead of  trying to stick background and filter to my #nav li ul, i've put those in my  #nav li<br>
That worked and didn't eat my 3rd level.</p>

<p>Christian, why do they refuse to upgrade? Upgrading would (or should, but don't tell them that) mean: improved performance and reduced safety risks (sounds like ie -yuck spit-). So suggestion 1: persuade them a bit more to upgrade. If that fails, you could may be do  a browsercheck. If browser=NN6 then load styleswithoutnav.css and load oldfashioned-dhtml-menus.js else just load standard.css<br>

<p>Nice! Thanks for that GJ. Following your lead, I put it on the #nav li li, as putting it on the #nav li set a background colour for the toplevel elements which screwed the pooch so to speak. The bit of transparency looks pretty swish I reckon. Thanks again!</p>

<p>Also, regarding Jens's (#74) comment (and a very thoughtful one at that).  Has anyone discovered how to make this menu work through tabing?  I've discovered that in fact that tabing is active - it's just not visible.  What I mean is, if you tab to the menu title - it's shows as being selected.  But, if you arrow down, nothing happens, another tab and the selection disapears, but upon hitting enter I'm taken to the following page.</p>

<p>Anyone come across a problem with the dropdowns when they roll over headings that use some kind of image replacement? In Firefox, because the list sits above the page content in the code, it sits below it in z-index, and so slips under the title. Then when you move down the list, as you get to the horizontal position of the title, the list thinks it's no-longer being hovered over, and dissapears. I've spent hours changing z-index's all over the place and haven't found the solution yet... =/</p>

<p>1.  The level 1 list is to big for the display (200+ entries).  How do I modify the css so that the level 1 menu is scrollable, but doesn't affect the level 2 or level 3 menus (i.e they still appear outside the scrolling region for the level 1 menu).</p>

<p>2. The process of displaying the level 2 menu is quite slow.  Is that a side effect of having such a large level 1 menu?</p>

<p>Though this article is getting old, I have a tip for people who might have had troubles like I had. You see, I had a menu in which some of the parent items weren't links, but since the code depends on the  "#nav a" rule to display the menu properly, these items' children displayed wrong. Ack! The solution was to wrap those non-linked items in a span and give the span a class (say, "no-link"), and then add that class to the above-mentioned rule so it says "#nav a, #nav span.no-link" instead.</p>

<p>That's a poor description, but I hope those of you who had a problem like mine will be able to get it.</p>

<p>My page has a vertical menu, and I put the css in its own file.  In IE, with that little piece of JavaScript (which is also in its own file) the second level ul list  only displays on hover, just like the ads say.  But in Mozilla/Firebird they are always visible. </p>

<p>BTW  - I experimented with the code.  I made my own local copy of the example page, and I put the css and JavaScript in their own files. Everything worked fine in both browsers.

You simply must to add a z-index here:</p>

	height: auto;<br>
	width: 10em;<br>

	margin: 0; <br>
                      z-index: 10; &lt;---------------------------------------------------<br>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment124"><span>Comment </span>124</a></h3>
<p>I've been attempting to implement this drop-down menu on my company's website and have run into some problems with (..not surprisingly..) IE5/Mac.  All other browsers were displaying everything just fine, but the IE kept applying all kinds of styling to the drop-down menus on mouseover, causing all kinds of odd effects and general mayhem.  After two days of tinkering with the style sheets and the JavaScript code, testing and re-testing, I found the problem and the fix.<br>
It may be because of how I have items styled in the documents, or the fact that I have multiple external style sheets and script files, etc - I don't know for sure.  The problem turned out to be in the JavaScirpt code that adds the " sfhover" class to the menu's "li" elements.  IE5/Mac does not like elements' classes to start with a space!  Once I discovered that, the solution was "simple":</p>

<p>function menuFix() {<br>
	var sfEls = document.getElementById("topmenu").getElementsByTagName("li");<br>
	for (var i=0; i0? " ": "") + "sfhover";<br>
		}<br>
		sfEls[i].onmouseout=function() {<br>
			this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp("( ?|^)sfhover\\b"), "");<br>
		}<br>
	}<br>
}</p>

<p>The important difference in the handling of the className in the mouseover and mouseout functions.  In the first case (onmouseover function), a space is added only if the element already has a class.  In the second case, the regular expression was modified to account for optional blank space (the " ?" part) or match the beginning of the string otherwise.  I'm pretty sure there is a way to simplify this, but I am not gonna worry about that.</p>

<p>I hope this helps to whoever may have had/will have this kind of problem.</p>

I made sure to change the "topmenu" id to "nav."  I also left in if (window.attachEvent) window.attachEvent("onload", sfHover); after the function.  Is it possible to see a working example of the code you have produced?  Thanks.    <br>

<p>I was able to make these menus work in IE 5.x Mac with some help from Anatoly's code.  He did all the leg work, I just cleaned it up.  It seems MT really distorted the code when it was posted.  It added some html entities that broke the script.  I posted a working version for all to use. More detail on the script  is located at this page:</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
first of all this code is wonderful, and I want to thank the authors.<br>
Then, I have a strange problem with the javascript and the with IE.<br>
I'm trying to attach my  dropdown menu in an on line forum I've installed on my server. The forum is infopop UBB and is written in perl. The forum Control Panel, allow me to insert html code inside the HEAD tag, so I've inserted here the suckerfish javascript.<br>
When I apply the changes inside the control panel, the system CHANGE this code:<br>
(new RegExp(" sfhover\\b"), "")<br>
with this:<br>
(new RegExp(" sfhover\b"), "")</p>

<p>so, to fix this, I've deleted - \\b - and the dropdown menu function as well, it seems.<br>
What  does \\b do?<br>
What do you think of this?<br>
Thank You,<br>
</p>

<p>Is it possible to put like a 500 millisecond of delay before the menu disappears? Right now it takes a lot of coordination to actually navigate using the menu.. if you move your mouse a little off then everything disappears and you gotta start over.</p>

Works fine at all levels for ie v6.  Can't see why it should fail either.  On the "pretty" example, if you add another set of lists to level below say Caulolatilus you will see it fails that level only in Firefox.</p>

<p>Grandchild of Suckerfish?</p>

<p>I've been working on keyboard accessibility for the suckerfish menus, and I think I've got as far as I can. I've extended the javascript to enable propogation of the :focus pseudo-class up the menu (something you can't do in css) and pushed the no-javascript css as hard as i could to get the currently focussed menu item and the sub-menu below it displaying. The no-javascript behaviour is a little odd, but the keyboard accessibility with javascript on works well. Here's the bare bones 2-level example:</p>

<p>Regarding 134 (Time Delay) I would love to have found the answer but after many hours(!) have not.  The pinnacle of my achievemnet was this line in the Javascript:<br>
sfEls[i].onmouseout=function(){thisid=this.id;setTimeout('document.all[thisid].className=document.all[thisid].className.replace(new RegExp(" sfhover\\b"), "");',500)};}<br>
It doesn't  work.<br>
Basically the big problem I found was that once you have to time delay something, you have to use Javascript's setTimeout() function, which is only executed when the delay expires, by which time the script has lost its scope and doesn't remember what 'this' referred to. My attempted workaround is probably rather feeble, but I thought it might prompt better brains than mine.<br>

<p>Thanks so much for this walk through. Can't wait to use it for my personal site... though I don't think I'll have enough content to warrant so many levels of drop downs.</p>

<p>A question though. I am using the menu along with a javascript rollover. so I'm calling both. Well I guess in IE it calls the JS you provided automatically, and I'm having it call another script whenever a mouse hovers over the top level image. This works fine in IE6 and Firefox. But in IE5, it doesn't seem to work. When I hover over it, the image changes, and I see the link it is supposed to go to in the status bar. But I can't click on it. However I can click on the links that do end up dropping down. I just can't click on the top menu which is an image.</p>

<p>I know this isn't really a problem with your tutorial, but I'm a total noob and I've been going crazy over this. It's like a tease, it recognizes that the image is a link, but I just can't seem to click on it. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Has anyone gotten this to work with image rollovers as the top menu in IE 5.0? It works in every other browser I tried except IE 5.0. The drop down works, but the images itself are unclickable, though when hovered over, the link shows up in the status bar.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was some problem with the javascript rollover, so I replaced it with a pure CSS rollover: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2001/03/23/rollovers.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2001/03/23/rollovers.html</a> which works great by the way. However that didn't solve the problem.</p>

<p>After doing a bit of reading, it seems as though it may be a CSS support problem in IE5.0 (non-Mac). From someone in a forum "well, nothing based on CSS2 will ever work on ie5.0 so a different approach might be the only way, like doing it the old fashioned JS way."</p>

<p>However I don't really know what in this code is based on CSS2. The CSS rollover by itself works in IE5, and the drop downs by itself works in IE5. It seems that when putting them together, it'll fail to work in IE5.</p>

<p>Hondo, the javascript is only needed for IE browsers. You can either place it into the document's header, or reference it from the header to an external .js file. The javascript is already posted in the tutorial itself.

<p>I am still pretty much a CSS newbie, and I am having a problem. The "line-height" is set to 1 in to #nav, #nav ul selector, yet the line is still way thicker than the Suckerfish example. I want the line-height to be thin like the example, but it isn't getting that way. Does anyone know what I may be missing?</p>

<p>Re 153<br>
I had the same issue and just copied the javascript making hover1 and hover2.  Works for me!</p>

<p>Also, I have reversed the order of a list and set the floats to right, so that my entire menu is right justified.  So far, everything is wroking except for the ubiquitous Mac IE issues.  In my case, the issue is that, since I want a static space between the menu items, I avoid setting a width to the li, and just set padding to left and right.  This works great everywhere but Mac IE, where each li is on its own separate line...  most irksome and would really like to figure this one out...  If anybody else has had any luck with having the width of the li determined by the text within it, I would be most interested in hearing how!!</p>

<p>RE 112<br>
If your seeing the same thing I am seeing - a really slow mouse movement at the submenus will cause the submenus to close, the issue is the border. You need to pull the submenus in just a touch so there isn't a gap between the menu and the sub menu.</p>

<p>Provided Example:<br>
#nav li ul ul {<br>
	margin: -1.75em 0 0 14em;<br>
}</p>

<p>What I use:<br>
#nav li ul ul {<br>
	margin: -1.75em 0 0 13.75em;  <br>
}</p>

<p>R154<br>
You need to use a z-index to put the drop downs above your columns. </p>

<p>#nav, #nav ul {<br>
	float: left;<br>
	[snip]<br>
	z-index: 100;<br>

<p>Answer for Ray Lynne (#101) and Henry (#114)...</p>

<p>The #nav li:hover, #nav li.sfhover  for a background colour does work, as long as you don't have any other background colours specified on a:links. </p>

<p>eg if you have: <br>
#nav li a:hover{ <br>
   background-color:#FFF;<br>
} <br>
then that overrides the<br>
 #nav li:hover {<br>
   background-color:#FFF;<br>
}<br>
so the trick is to only specify background colours for the menu items in  and not apply them to the  links. This will make the background colour stay on the item as you use the drop down menu.<br>

<p>Here are the problems:</p>

<p>1. it doens't show submenu's in IE no more!</p>

<p>2. the first row of buttons needs to be in a yellow square when hovered (like the smartmenu)</p>

<p>3. the first row isn't centered in Firefox</p>

<p>4. the left and right border of my menu are gone (in IE and FF)</p>

<p>5. A submenu that has a furhter subsubmenu needs to have an arrow ( <a href="http://www.31tigersqn.be/nieuw/images/arrow.gif">http://www.31tigersqn.be/nieuw/images/arrow.gif</a> )</p>

<p>6. Also the submenu's are to large in width. I'm having problems with this. E.g. armament --&gt; electronic warfare &amp; countermeasures. When I make the list just a little bit smaller, that line takes 2 rows instead of the 1 now. But still there is a lot of space at the right of that string. Can't I make that smaller but keep it in 1 row??</p>

<p>Please mail me or something at webmaster[at]31tigersqn.be</p>

<p>Brilliant System!  Of course, I have a nightmare project that has me fighting all the different browers.  Here's the test:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dropthatsock.com/template1.php">http://www.dropthatsock.com/template1.php</a></p>

<p>OK - TWO QUESTIONS.</p>

<p>One - I had to make the "nav" into a class instead of an id.   So my stylesheet refers to .nav {blah blah blah} instead of #nav {blah blah blah}  The reason i did this is that I have more than one which appear and disapear when you roll over certain headers.</p>

<p>So  -  this seems to muck up the magic javascript for Internet Explorer, my guess is this line:  </p>

<p>document.getElementById("nav")</p>

<p>So can that javascript be altered in any way to get this to work in IE?</p>

<p>SECOND question - as much as I want to burn these browsers, my client requires that I get this to work on IE 5.2.  It's not working of course!  This may or may not be related to the same bug above?</p>

<p>Is there a way to make the border of the menu an image, rather than a solid line?  I'm working on a site that uses dropdowns and we're currently using a bloated, clunky dreamweaver extension to create the dropdowns, and then pasting the code that it generates into the header for the site.  I'd like to replace this with a more lightweight solution, and I love this technique but I can't use it unless I can use images for the borders.</p>

<p>Well, I had this working pretty well with the original Suckerfish dropdown code, but then I decided to be "prudent" and use Son of Suckerfish for greater compatibility.  I'm not so great at CSS yet, and I must be braindead at this hour, but I can't figure out how to adjust the width of the parent items.</p>

<p>I'm using a background image in the LI tag of each item, and they're of different widths.  The original code let me assign a different class to each (i.e. li#home) so I could assign the widths individually.  How do I do that with the Son of Suckerfish code?</p>

<p>I know there must be an easy way, but I'm just blanking.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>I really like the elegance and beauty of the (Sons of) Suckerfish Dropdowns!</p>

<p>Not being an expert, I have tweaked and hammered this menu system to work throughout my site, <a href="http://www.culshaw.info/">http://www.culshaw.info.</a> I am quite happy with its performance and I plan on keeping it (as opposed to some DHTML solutions with which I have played).</p>

<p>There is just one thing that I have not been able to figure out on my own -- and I am going insane trying to find a solution. At the moment, each of my pages within my site has the entire menu system "embedded" within it. This means that any change to a single menu item requires me to update all of the pages on my site (so that the menu stays consistent regardless of which page the viewer is currently viewing).  Is there anyway to seperate out all of the menu elements of each page into a single file that is referenced by all of the pages that uses the menu? I guess what I am after is a similar behaviour as when you can create one CSS file that all pages can reference.  For the Suckerfish, it probably means more javascript to make something like this happen? To ensure that all links are relative to each page linked? I am totally clueless...</p>

<p>Any info as to whether this is possible would be *very* much appreciated. Please e-mail me if you need more explaination as to what I am trying to find a solution.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I've got the dropdown menu working nicely in IE now, but it's still messing up in Firefox and Netscape 7.  Both of these other browers also have a display issue wherein there's a blank space just above the menu, which is throwing off the rest of the layout.  The dropdowns themselves are crunching down into a single line instead of multiple line items.  It does this whether or not there's a background image behind the menu items.</p>

<p>You can take a look here (a site I'm working on for a client):  www.asampuc.org/workingmenu.html</p>

<p>If any kind soul can help me figure this out, I'd be very grateful!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p><br>
Devon</p>

<p>BTW...  I discovered a couple of answers to vexing issues that I might as well spell out here, for other people who may come later.</p>

<p>1.  The dropdowns won't work inside a TABLE (at least, I could never get them to in IE6).</p>

<p>2.  To adjust the width of the UL headers, look for this line:  #nav li ul a  <br>
If you need variable widths for your header items, assign a different class to each, like this:</p>

<p>#nav li.welcome ul a {<br>
	width: 96px;<br>
	w\idth: 96px;<br>
}</p>

<p>#nav li.region ul a {<br>
	width: 149px;<br>
	w\idth: 149px;<br>
}</p>

<p><br>
#nav li.leader ul a {<br>
	width: 151px;<br>
	w\idth: 151px;<br>
}</p>

<p><br>
Then in the HTML, put each class designation in its respective LI tag:  	</p>

<p><br>
Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you to Lawrence Akka (posts # 49 &amp; 50), Anatoly (posts # 124 &amp; 125) , and Matthew Carroll (post #142). I have been able to combine each of your fixes to come up with a fully functional, and accessable, menu.  I have tested the end result  on both Windows and Mac boxes (OS 9.2.2 and OS X 10.3.7)  and it works great.</p>

<p>In Windows, I tested using IE 6.0 (I haven't been able to find a station with an earlier version), Netscape 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, Mozilla 1.7.2, Firefox 0.9.3, Opera 6.0.6, 7.54. The only browser that did not work was Opera 6.0.6. The mouseover effect works on the root level menu items for both mousing and accessability (control, down arrow), but the drop-downs don't work.</p>

<p>On a Mac (OS 9.2.2) I tested using IE 5.0, 5.1.7, Netscape 6.0.1, 7.0, Opera 6.0.3. It worked in all browsers except Netscape 6.0.1 and Opera 6.0.3.  When I mouseover in Netscape, I can see the drop-down text appear, but there is no background color. The accessability feature does not work. In Opera, only the root level mouseover effect works with both mouseovers and accessability features.</p>

<p>On a Mac (OS X 10.3.7) I tested using IE 5.2.3, Netscape 7.2, Safari 1.2.4, Firefox 1.0, and Opera 7.54. It worked in IE, Safari, and Opera. I could not figure out how to use the accessability feature in Netscape or Firefox. I tried several key combinations, but the best I could  do in both was toggle between the address bar and the browser window. </p>

<p>I would appreciate it if someone could test with Windows IE5.x, and Mac OS X Netscape and Firefox (or at least tell me how to use accessablility in these browsers). Here is the address for my test page:</p>

<p>one other problem in IE and Mozilla is that when you have a flash movie just below the buttons, the flash movie will order the drop down menu back behind it so you won't see the links on the menu.<br>

<p>I'm also pretty new to this stuff but have certainly  enjoyed playing around with it (despite a few frustrating moments).</p>

<p>I do have a couple of comments first, in regards to devon's comment in post #166.1 he said that it cant be put in tables in IE6. I got it to work. I didnt do anything special though, I just put it in and made sure I left my tr and td tags in there.</p>

<p>My last item is a request. I've only been able to test in IE6 and Firefox 1.0 seeing as that is all I have available to me. If you have the time and browser capabilities, could you please  take a look and see if it looks okay. There is a list in the "content" part that has a brute version of the list.</p>

<p>I've got a solution to a problem (as seen in post #134 and #174), and a question of my own.  Hopefully by offering this tidbit, I might get a bite to assist with my problem.  Not a virgin sacrifice, I know...but  it's worth a shot.</p>

<p>The problem with Flash is that, in most any case using DHTML and layers, Flash doesn't recognize that it belongs on the bottom.  On the contrary, it believes it's more important than anything ("how conceited of Macromedia," a friend of mine said about this issue once) and sticks itself above all layers.</p>

<p>However, there's a fix to it that has nothing to do with your stylesheets.  In your document, add this PARAM line:</p>

<p>&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt; </p>

<p>And that should do the trick.</p>

<p>Now, for my question...</p>

<p>I have this *wonderful wonderful amazing* menu to work in *all* of the browsers I have, except one, of course.  Well, wait, that's not true.  It works in all of them - I just have an *issue* with one of them.  My drop-down is only one level, but in Mac Safari 1.0.3 (who knew that was coming?), for some reason, when I hover over the links, the dropdown menu appears all the way to the left, at the very beginning of the menu.  So the menu item to the far right, when moused over the dropdown shows under the first link.  And, of course, it doesn't stay long enough for someone to move the mouse to the dropdown - as soon as you leave that "button" the dropdown disappears.  (Hope I made sense there.)</p>

<p>Just for the record, the platforms/browsers I've checked it in are Windows XP: Opera7, Firefox, IE 6 and Netscape 7; and on my Mac (OSX) I've got it working in IE 5 and Safari 1.0.3 (except for the above-mentioned issue).  I also have access to IE5 on Win 98 and Netscape 4, but I haven't checked it there yet (and am I *really* hoping for a miracle?  Yeah, right.)</p>

<p>Anyway, if anyone has a quick Safari fix for my issue, I'd much appreciate it.</p>

<p>This thing Rocks! I have a question though. I plan on deploying this to as a pseudo replaacement for an advanced selectbox. Ive retooled the css to include 5 identical #nav styles and compied the js script 5 times replacing the variables in all of the scripts. This works fine in Mozilla but not in IE. Im guessing this has something to do with IE's treatment of IDs. Does any one have any suggestions on how to deploy numerous menus on one page. For example 5? </p>

<p>I've been using Eric Meyer's excellent approach with csshover.htc, which he details in More Eric Meyer on CSS, and also the Suckerfish JavaScript technique. Both methods work fine. At the moment, I'm favoring Suckerfish simply because it's just a few lines of JavaScript code, while csshover.htc is a much larger file.</p>

<p>Safari 1.0: As others have noted, Suckerfish doesn't work properly in Safari 1.0, an old version still used by many. In fact, I've never been able to get any dropdown to work in Safari 1.0 (which happens to be my primary browser, tho I use Firefox a lot too). I recommend using the JavaScript posted by Harley Jacoubsen at <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/discuss/dropdowns/13/#c6369">http://www.alistapart.com/discuss/dropdowns/13/#c6369</a><br>
This keeps the dropdown menus hidden from Safari versions before 1.1 (build 86). Safari 1.0 users will need to navigate in more than one click.</p>

<p>// Sniff pre v.86 versions of Safari<br>
var agt       = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();<br>
var appVer    = navigator.appVersion.toLowerCase();<br>
var is_safari = (agent.indexOf("safari") != -1);<br>
var build     = appVer.substring(appVer.lastIndexOf("/")+1);<br>
if (build &lt; 86) {<br>
	document.write('&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;ul#nav li:hover ul {display: none}&lt;\/style&gt;');<br>
}</p>

I'm going with the following loading method, which seems to work fine in the several browsers I'm able to test with: Windows IE 6, Mac IE 5.23, and Mac Firefox 1.0. If someone sees a problem with this code, I'd love to hear about it.</p>

<p>if (document.all) { // Load sfHover only in IE; other browsers don't need it<br>
	if (window.attachEvent) window.attachEvent("onload", sfHover);<br>
	else window.onload = sfHover; // Mac IE5 needs this<br>

<p>JavaScript supports closures. In simple terms that means that when a function is created it can capture a variable that exists in the scope in which it was created.</p>

<p>For suckerfish it means that the onmouseout function doesn’t need to create a new RegExp object every time it executes. For that matter the onmouseover and onmouseout functions don’t need to be recreated in every iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>The version of the code below reuses the same three objects instead of creating three new objects for every menu item.</p>

<p><br>
function sfHover()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var sfEls = document.getElementById("nav").getElementsByTagName("LI");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (sfEls.length)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var fnMouseOver = function() { this.className += " sfHover"; };</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var re = / sfHover\b/;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var fnMouseOut = function() { this.className = this.className.replace(re, ""); };</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (i = 0; (i &lt; sfEls.length); ++i)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sfEls[i].onmouseover = fnMouseOver;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sfEls[i].onmouseout = fnMouseOut;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}</p>

<p>While this looks great and and all, there's the problem that you now cannot use unordered lists on any page with these menus, which alas is something I cannot afford. Several others have asked this in the discussion, but no one has offered any solutions. I'm not good enough at CSS to understand how to limit the style change to a specific  on the page. I.e.</p>

<p>On the Mac, Firefox and Mozilla are buggy when the menu items are more than a single line. When you mouse over a two-line parent of a second-level dropdown, miscellaneous lines of text show through the menu as the new dropdown appears. See <a href="http://pighog.com/suckerfish">http://pighog.com/suckerfish</a> -- mouse down the middle (TEST) menu until you hit the "Trigger" line and you'll see what I mean. (Tested in Firefox 1.0 and 1.0.1 and Mozilla 1.7.5 on OS X 10.3.8.)</p>

<p>The PC incarnations don't have this bug, and neither does IE6, or Safari, for that matter.</p>

In other words .. in my book, thats just simply talking ___t. I am very impressed and I am using the suckerfish on an admin level side of a site that badly needed one. The admin are going to use modern browsers that are compatible because they want to use the system. Awesome for me : ) You made my life easier and I want to say thanks.

<p>re: comment #189 &amp; #190:</p>

<p>I've learned that the nesting that is present in the css solves these problems. Take a look at the 'pretty' example: <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/example/">http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/example/</a> and then look at the stylesheet in the source to see that all the drop menu styles are contained in the #nav id. This makes it so that all the ul's and stuff are only effected when they are in the #nav.</p>

<p>hope that helps!</p>

<p>I can't locate the post that asked about separating the menus from the html, so to avoid having to redo a lot of pages in case of additions or changes, and that problem has bugged me too.....<br>
and I've found out that you can get the desired effect by using another snippet of javascript, and plain old document.write() function.....</p>

<p>mind me, I'm no expert in javascript, hell, I'm barely getting along with html and css (love the htmldog, though :) ), so I know there are better solutions to this one, but this is just my $0.02....</p>

<p>first off, putting the links in document.write() will disrupt the flow, and js will shred the table into a series of strings. to avoid that, I've placed all links and ids into different variables, and it finally looks something like this:</p>

<p>var id = "nav"<br>
var link = "#"<br>
document.write("&lt; ul id=" + id + "&gt; &lt; li&gt; &lt; a href=" + link + "&gt; &lt; .........")</p>

<p>and it just gets inserted back in, using the <br>
&lt; script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="script.js"&gt; &lt; /script&gt; </p>

<p>hope it can help, if not for you pros, maybe for some newb like me :)</p>

<p>Holy moly ... 207 comments is a LOT!  Didn't read them all, but wanted to point out a small visual flaw in MSIE6sp2.</p>

<p>On the pretty version, if you move your mouse SLOWLY into the 2nd level menu ... it disappears.  Only if you move rapidly into the 2nd level do you have an option to highlight and select.</p>

<p>It doesn't do this on the less pretty example, so wonder if there is a pixel or two width between levels, causing the mouse to be outside the :hover zone?  </p>

<p>Personally, I like the single drop-down the best, as there are accessibility issues with more.  I also have a belief that site content should be ordered no more than 2 clicks away.</p>

<p>Great Job.  Thanks for sharing.</p>

<p>How do you change the size of the /* second-level lists */ with css?  I have a dropdown with a second menu for browesing alphabetically A-Z, the A-Z list should fit nicely into the drop boxes, however they don't.  The A-Z list has way too much space for its own good.  How can one fix this problem?  Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>I'd like to use this code _and_  obtain XHTML 1.0 Strict validation.</p>

<p>w3c.org presents 5 reports. I've come across, and solved  #1 before. Anyone have a clue for the rest? I'm not a scriptor.</p>

<p>1. Line 11, column 17: there is no attribute "language"</p>

<p></p>

<p>You have used the attribute named above in your document, but the document type you are using does not support that attribute for this element. This error is often caused by incorrect use of the "Strict" document type with a document that uses frames (e.g. you must use the "Transitional" document type to get the "target" attribute), or by using vendor proprietary extensions such as "marginheight" (this is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve the desired effect instead).</p>

<p>This error may also result if the element itself is not supported in the document type you are using, as an undefined element will have no supported attributes; in this case, see the element-undefined error message for further information.</p>

<p>How to fix: check the spelling and case of the element and attribute, (Remember XHTML is all lower-case) and/or check that they are both allowed in the chosen document type, and/or use CSS instead of this attribute.</p>

<p>2. Line 14, column 29: character ";" not allowed in attribute specification list</p>

<p>for (var i=0; i" element), or by using vendor proprietary extensions such as "" or "" (this is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve the desired effect instead).</p>

<p>4. Line 24, column 8: end tag for "sfEls.length" omitted, but OMITTAG NO was specified</p>

<p></p>

<p>You may have neglected to close a tag, or perhaps you meant to "self-close" a tag; that is, ending it with "/&gt;" instead of "&gt;".</p>

<p>I need some help with the menus functioning in Win and Mac IE. I've got a layout working in Firefox 1.0 on Win and Mac, as well as Safari 1.2. My main hangup right now is the fact that the menus do not display in Win IE 6 (I don't have a box with Win IE 5, but I suspect it breaks the same there too). In Mac IE the menus show up as vertical lists, but this really isn't the target audience - our focus will be Win IE.</p>

<p>I'm sure I've beat up the code in ways I shouldn't have - this is my first experiment with full CSS layout with no tables - so I need someone to hit me on the head and say, "Well if you did _this_ with your code everything would work fine. Duh."</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>

<p>I checked your menu with the following browsers:<br>
Windows - The dropdowns don't work in IE5, but they are set horizontally across the page under the photo. The menu works fine in Opera7.54, Netscape7.02, Mozilla1.7.2, and FireFox0.9.3</p>

<p>Mac - The menu appears stacked and centered under the photo instead of horizontally in IE5. The dropdowns do work, but they appear against the left margin.<br>
The menu works fine in the following browsers, except the secondary dropdown acts differently. There is about a 10px gap between the primary and seconary dropdowns in: Opera7.54, Netscape7.2, and FireFox1.0. In Safari1.2.4(v125.12) the secondary dropdown is positioned OK, but it is about half as wide as in all other browsers.</p>

<p>I don't know if this will help, but here is the CSS as I am using it in a current project. The page can be viewed at <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/~pet04785/GME/">http://www.creighton.edu/~pet04785/GME/</a><br>

<p>I have a IE5-Mac issue I am trying to fix with the secondary dropdowns. The secondary menus are positioned correctly in all Mac and Windows browsers except IE5-Mac. In IE5-Mac, the secondary dropdowns appear about 32px lower than they should. I've tried applying a Tan hack to move them up, but this also effects IE5-Windows, which is positioned correctly. Can anyone recommend how I can correct the problem in IE5-Mac with out effecting IE5-Windows? Is there a way to target a Tan hack to IE5-Mac so it doesn't effect IE5-Windows?

<p>Re: post 220</p>

<p>I'm responding to my own post with some fixes. Thanks to those who have posted in reply so far. </p>

<p>Part of my problem was the javascript launching the menus for PC IE. I had an older/other version of the menus that used "window.onload" to start everything. The current Suckerfish code uses "window.attachevent("onload", sfHover)" - this makes things work in PC IE properly. Things now look good in PC IE 5 and 6. </p>

<p>I did have to specify a fixed width for 3rd level menus to show them consistently in PC IE 5 and 6, and Mac/PC Firefox. Without a set width, the links/list items (styled with a background color) would not be the full width of their containing UL (also styled with a background color) in Firefox. Without a set width, the links would wrap to 2 lines in PC IE 5, but would not wrap in PC IE 6.</p>

<p>Things are still wonky in Mac IE 5; I'll need to review the code from post 224 - Paul's code renders fine on the Mac.</p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment227"><span>Comment </span>227</a></h3>
<p>After reading through this entire forum (took me about 1.5 hours) I noticed many of you want to know how to make the secondary menu popouts go to the left instead of to the right. You will be happy to know that the solution to your problem can be found in post #224 above. You need to list the margin as a negative amount equal to the width of your dropdown menu. In my menu, the dropdowns are 140px wide. Therefore the left margin is set to -140px</p>

<p>Example: #nav li ul ul.left_popout { margin: 126px 0 0 -140px; padding: 0 }.</p>

<p>In my menu, I am using both right and left popouts, so I created two classes: .right_popout and .left_popout. These classes are then applyed to the appropriate "ul" tag. Above is the CSS for the left popout. The CSS for the right popout is:</p>

<p>#nav li ul ul.right_popout1 { margin: 0 0 0 138px; padding: 0; position: absolute; top: 78px; left: 0 }</p>

<p>In addition, my right popouts are in different positions in my menu, so I had to create separte right popout classes for each top positioning. That is why I have .right_popout1 through .right_popout5. You can see these popouts in action by visiting the site I am currently working on:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.creighton.edu/~pet04785/GME/">http://www.creighton.edu/~pet04785/GME/</a></p>

<p>I haven't tried implementing this yet, but as far as the Netscape 6 problem, I would suggest trying to put one big "layer" tag around the whole page with a z-order of 0, and put all the dropdown info in a layer or layers with a higher z-order. Add a mouseover event to the 0 level layer to either hide the dropdown layer(s) or move them to the left as spec'ed in the tutorial. So when you mouse off of a menu, you are always mousing over an area that triggers the dropdowns disappearance. I used a similar solution back in the days of of N4, I think it should still work in N6 and not interfere with other browsers (IE will ignore the layer tag altogether), although you might be doubly hiding the dropdowns in N7 -- so I think the "left" solution would be easiest to avoid the need for additional hacks.</p>

<p>I'm having a slight problem with the javascript for IE. I have two navs, one that is at the root level of the server and one that is inside of a lower directory. The lower nav uses a php include to get the root nav, and then the page that has the nav is using a php include to get the lower nav file. </p>

<p>The problem is that no matter where I put the javascript code ( a call to an external js file or putting the actual code) I cannot get the dropdown to work on the lower nav. The code will apply to the upper nav and then stop working. If I remove the include for the top nav, the lower one starts working again. Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>JD (#230),</p>

<p>Have you tried applying separate IDs to the two different menus? You will have two sets of CSS code for the menus, one for the upper (root) menu and one for the lower menu. The IDs for the upper menu might appear as follows:<br>
#nav_upper { ...<br>
#nav_upper ul { ...<br>
#nav_upper a { ...<br>
and so forth.</p>

<p>The CSS for the lower menu might be:<br>
#nav_lower { ...<br>
#nav_lower ul { ...<br>
#nav_lower a { ...</p>

<p>Then in your HTML, the div for the upper menu would appear as:<br>
&lt;div id="nav_upper"&gt;</p>

<p>and the lower menu would be:<br>
&lt;div id="nav_lower"&gt; </p>

<p>I hope this helps you.</p>

<p>It's been tested on Windows in IE5.0, IE5.5, IE6.0, Mozilla 1.6, Mozilla Firefox 1.0.3, Netscape 7.2, Opera 7.54 en Opera 8.0 and on Linux in Mozilla 1.7.7, Firefox 1.0.3, Opera 8 en Konqueror 3.4.0<br>
I've had no opportunity to test is on MacOs. It would be great i've someone could give me feedback on that!</p>

<p>Paul (or anyone else who can help :) ),</p>

<p>Still having problems. I can get the lower one to work now, but I'm waiting for my boss(es) to take a look and I know they'll say "Can we have it on the upper part too?" So I want to nip it in the bud.</p>

<p>Problem is, now I can't get it to work for the upper part. I made some changes to the javascript (which I know nothing about) so that I have two functions; one is the same as the old one, the other just replaces the sf.* variables with _upper on the end. </p>

<p>Here follows the code I'm using:</p>

<p>nav.js:<br>
sfHover_upper = function() { <br>
	var sfEls_upper = document.getElementById("nav_upper").getElementsByTagName("LI"); <br>
	for (var i=0; iSiteDirectory </p>

<p>Link 1<br>
	<br>
		Test<br>
	</p>

<p>Link 2<br>
Link 3<br>
Link 4</p>

<p><br>
one of the sub navs:</p>

<p></p>

<p><br>
BCDirectory </p>

<p>	Link 1<br>
	Link 2<br>
	Link 3<br>
	Link 4<br>
	Link 5<br>
		<br>
			Sublink 1<br>
				<br>
					Sub Sublink 1<br>
				<br>
			<br>
			Sublink 2<br>
			Sublink 3<br>
			Sublink 4<br>
			Sublink 5<br>
		<br>
	<br>
	Link 6</p>

<p><br>
Please let me know if you need/want to see the css, but it's pretty standard, and it all works, except for the roll out in IE for the upper now.</p>

<p>Thanks a bunch!</p>

<p>Bah, I just noticed the text on the bottom about HTML...so, sorry for the double post, but here is the code (again) for the pages</p>

<p>upper nav:</p>

<p>&lt;span class = "box"&gt;&lt;span class="site"&gt;Site&lt;span class = "directory"&gt;Directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; <br>
&lt;ul id="nav_upper"&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;link 1 &lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Sublink 1 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 2 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 3 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 4 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p><br>
Lower nav: <br>
&lt;script src="includes/nav.js" language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;? include("includes/side_nav.php");<br>
  ?&gt;<br>
&lt;span class = "box"&gt;&lt;span class="site"&gt;BC&lt;span<br>
  class = "directory"&gt;Directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; <br>
&lt;ul id="nav"&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 1 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 2 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 3 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 4 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 5 &lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Sublink 1 &lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Sub Sublink 1 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Sublink 2 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Sublink 3 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Sublink 4 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Sublink 5 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 6 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>I think something that is important/may be the problem is that I'm getting the Javascript and then including the php for the upper nav, but which one takes precedence? I tried to put the js link in the upper nav but it still didn't work...do I need to use a php include for that, too, so it will get executed before the php?</p>

<p>JD,</p>

<p>It sounds like the problem is with your JS file. Unfortunately, I don't know JS, but you shouldn't need to change the JS file. I posted a sample page using two dropdown menus at the address listed below. All I did to set this up was create two differently named sets of CSS for both menus, as I have mentioned in post #231, then applying the names to the two different menus. So if you change your JS file back to the original code, it should work. Feel free to copy my code if it will help you to get your menus working. Here is the link to my test page:</p>

<p>JD,</p>

<p>Hold on my last message. The set up does work, just not in any version of IE. Sorry, I checked it in Safari, Netscape and FireFox, but didn't think about IE. Freudian slip, there. So you probably do need to modify the JS file to get this to work in IE since the JS file was originally created to make the menu work in IE.</p>

<p>Paul,</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time. I figured it was something with the javascript, and I think it has something to do with the fact that I call the js (which looks for "nav"), it does a document request in the first file, applies the code and then finished. By the time the second nav is loaded, the java is finished running. </p>

<p>I've tried a few different things, none of which work, including separate js files with different code, the same code, putting the js call in different spots, etc. So I'm thinking that this needs some way to do either a Next, or some type of loop where it doesn't search just one document in the case of an include. </p>

<p>I'm no javascript expert myself, so this has me really stumped.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've put the dropdown system into my forums, and Im having a problem. I'm trying to make it look like it did originally, only add a drop down menu to the "My controls".</p>

<p>Original:<br>
My Controls - View New Posts - My Assistant - Veiw Inbox</p>

<p>After I added it (and it took a serious amount of tweaking to get it this close.) it looks like this:<br>
My Controls                                       -Veiw New Posts - My Assistant - Veiw Inbox</p>

<p>Not only that, but since I'm an admin I have the "Admin CP" option next to it, which got bumped to a row above it. To compensate I moved it after the "Veiw inbox".</p>

<p>The reason for this is hard to figure out in firefox, but when I veiwed it in IE i saw what was happening. It was making the menu appear next to the words "My control" instead of directly below it. It needed that space for the menu it thinks should be there.</p>

<p>Any way of solving this problem? Heres a link: <a href="http://rschaos.ultrameg.com/forum/index.php?act=idx">http://rschaos.ultrameg.com/forum/index.php?act=idx</a></p>

<p>Hi. After some hours reading all this posts, I want to thank this great menu. I tryied it some days ago, with the code posted in alistapart, but it was not working properly. I will try this one.<br>
The problem is that I need two menus on my site, one is just like the one you have made, and the other is a vertical one. The problem is that I don't want is to drop down on mouse over, i want it to expand on mouse click and to remain open when you are navigating in that section.<br>
I've found lot of menus like this, but they use a lot of lines of javascript. I would like to know if someone has found this kind of menu, with few lines of js, just like suckerfish menu.<br>
Thanks in advance.<br>

<p>I've tried to adapt the "Son of Suckerfish" code (and you can see I use some from the original "Suckerfish" dropdown menu code) into a new site I'm working on. I have tested this on several mac products (Firefox, Opera, Safari) and although it has a bit of a bug in Safari that I still need to fix - I'm pretty pleased. </p>

<p>However, the submenu's do not work at all on (PC) IE. I don't know if somehow the JS is now incompatible with what I wrote, or what my problem is (mozilla is of course, fine-and-dandy). If not the JS, then perhaps something to do with trying to meld the two codes together.</p>

<p>Can someone check out the site and give me a clue? I'm still new to CSS, and clueless about JS.<br>

/* Fix IE. Hide from IE Mac \*/<br>
* html ul li { float: left; }<br>
* html ul li a { height: 1%; height: 1%;}<br>

[/CODE]</p>

<p>breaks unordered lists elsewhere in the page? </p>

<p><br>
A Solution:</p>

<p>Yes, the code above will affect all unordered lists on the page. The solution I have used is to place the nav lists inside a div with an id of "menu" like this:</p>

<p>[CODE]<br>
&lt;div id="menu"&gt;<br>
&lt;ul id="nav"&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Item 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Item 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;! -- etc. --&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
[/CODE]</p>

<p>Then the CSS code would say:</p>

<p>[CODE]<br>
/* Fix IE. Hide from IE Mac \*/<br>
* html #menu ul li { float: left; }<br>
* html #menu ul li a { height: 1%; height: 1%;}<br>
/* End */<br>

<p>O.k., I figured out how to fix my problem. </p>

<p>What I did was I moved the ul id="nav" tag to the top of my local nav include file, then included the main nav after that. In the main nav I removed all the UL tags.</p>

<p>Then I just left the closing UL tag at the end of the file. Now the rollouts work for both sets of navigation files. </p>

<p>I wish there was a better way to do this with the javascript, but this is close enough for me. </p>

<p>Like Andrew in #44, I found that Win IE was making the menus drop down from the center of their parent buttons instead of aligning along the left edge.  Thanks to IdahoEv for #59, which lead me to the solution. As he suggested, I applied the text-align: center to #nav a, not #nav li. It was a partial solution to the problem. I just wanted to add one other thing, in case other newbies like me are making the same mistake. I had placed the "Sons of Suckerfish" menu inside a cell in an html table. It seems that the align="center" attribute in the cell was causing all the trouble. When I removed it, the problem went away. I am happy to report that I now have this wonderful dropdown menu system working for Win IE, Mac IE 5.2, Mac Netscape 7.1 and Safari 1.3.</p>

<p>Whaaaat!?</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a question, and I don't know how pertinent it is because I'm going on the premise that web users are not too bright and I must accomodate for techno-illiteracy.<br>
Thus said, the one thing the Suckerfish menu doesn't have that alot of rubbish JavaScript menus do have is a delay when the mouse leaves the menu... or list... This really helps with sub-menus in place, because if you're not a dab hand at mouse helmsmanship it can become quite irritating. I just imagine my Mum trying to use it and i see a problem on a global scale... Any solution anyone? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>No there are no printing issues, check-ch-check-check -check-ch-czech it out... by printing Mr Griffiths' example.</p>

<p>I found another wizard use for the SuckerFish hover technique - which is a list image swap, much like emulating a javascript menu with image rollovers.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>.nav li {<br>
	list-style: url(image1.gif);<br>
}</p>

<p>.nav li:hover, .nav li.sfhover {<br>
	list-style: url(image2.gif);<br>
}</p>

<p>The only thing you have to do is take out the "getElementsById" function (as mentioned in one of the articles) in the JavaScript. Note I've used classes here because I'm using the list more than once on a page.</p>

<p>You can also apply this to background images. It works i tells ya!</p>

<p>The only thing is I now want to know how to apply this technique to classes which aren't within a list, as it would be perfect for image rollovers yes'm. Also applying the SuckerFish to a class as opposed to an ID would be brill as you could use it more than once on a page.</p>

<p>I just suck at JavaScript...</p>

<p>Argh.</p>

<p>In Opera, this has very strange results, whereby it replaces the list syle with the default as opposed to taking any notice of the image. Why? Who knows. This website building business has taken me 3 years to not understand.</p>

<p>If I'm talking to myself then fair do's I'll go find a design forum. If I'm not, then I'd really appreciate any help anyone can give. Ta very much like.</p>

<p>Hmmm... It appears using a "background-image" as opposed to a "list-style-image" is a good work-around, but you have to fiddle with the paddings, margins and text-indents. </p>

<p>Which will have different effects in bloody IE.</p>

<p>If anyone was interested in my list-image-change-on-mouse-over escapades, then you'll be pleased to know I've found an obvious solution.</p>

<p>If you have lists of links and want to change the list image on a 'rollover' without using JavaScript, then set a class for the anchor tag, say for instance ".listlink a: ..." </p>

<p>Give "a" a pictoral background and "a:hover" a different image background and make sure it's properties are set so it's to the left and doesn't repeat.  Set the padding to the left to the width of said image, and voila you have anchor tags that look like list elements. You have to mess around with the containing list so it doesn't display any bullets or whatever style you may have previously set, and the positioning may need altering.</p>

<p>Incase you didn't understand any of my explanation, which was more of a keyboard ramble than a real explanation - here is an example of my "discovery".</p>

<p>ul.subnav {<br>
	margin: 0 0 0 1.5em;<br>
	padding: 0;<br>
}</p>

<p>.subnav li {<br>
	text-indent: -1.5em;<br>
	line-height: 10px;<br>
	margin: 0 0 4px 0;<br>
	list-style-type: none;<br>
}</p>

<p>.subnav a {<br>
	padding-left: 1em;<br>
	background: url(images/image1.gif) left no-repeat;<br>
}</p>

<p>.subnav a:hover {<br>
	background: url(images/image2.gif) left no-repeat;<br>
}</p>

<p>In reply to #258 who has the same question as me, yes, a delay is possible but it will take learning a little JavaScript which i haven't had the time to do yet or I would be telling you the answer right now... JavaScript buffs seem to have abandoned the area.</p>

<p>seems like this javascript applies the class to all level elements (if we need only one level there's no need for that?) and we could play only with link background and combining this with  default background we should get non flickering ie menus?</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/eventmodels.html">http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/eventmodels.html</a> contains an article on supporting the three basic event models in use on the web. It includes some object testing and property detection as well as techniques to implement these detections in such a way that the same event handler code will work and attach to objects across most browsers.</p>

<p>Using this and the suckerfish shoal to attach hover to elements in the list besides the link tags only when it is nescessary seems a more elegant solution than testing for document,all and running the shoal in a conditional.</p>

<p>This allows you to also attach specific event triggers to elements of your dropdowns dependent on the browsers handling of the dom etc instead of sniffing user agents.</p>

<p>I haven't played with this yet.. but attaching events to some of the actions using both the 3 event model and suckerfish classes for ie functionality could make for some interesting menus. Anyone want to play around with this with me.. send me an email. Yahoo account listed since it's spamtastic already.<br>

<p>Chris - I think your javascript error is generated by a  tag where you placed  instead of the  around the menus. Firefox has evidently 'overlooked' this, but IE isn't liking it so much.<br>
However the menu still isn't working in IE so I will continue to investigate that.</p>

<p>In reference to post 165 - </p>

<p>John, I had a quick look at your site and it doesn't seem like you have found (or at least implemented) a solution to your issue.</p>

<p>I have successfully implemented Suckerfish using a server side include. Are you familiar with these? They're extremely powerful. Once you start using them you'll never stop! I am using a Windows server with IIS6. I'm not sure this method will work in a different server environment.</p>

<p>I'm no expert, but you'll need to start using some dynamic server pages. Mine are all ASP, vbscript.</p>

<p>Basically all you need to do is take the code that you want to appear on all your pages, and paste it into a separate file. Only include the code you want, nothing else - ie., no html, meta or body tags etc. </p>

<p>In the case of suckerfish, just copy the whole unordered list (ul) and paste it into a new file. Call it whatever you want, say 'menu' and save it with a .asp file extension. And I repeat - there shouldn't be any other code on the file - just the menu list.</p>

<p>Now, in all the pages you want the menu to appear, replace the current ul list with the include file like this:</p>

<p><br>
(You may have to use " instead)</p>

<p>Any page that includes this include file will need to be saved with a .asp extension as well.</p>

<p>Now, when you need to edit the menu, all you need to do is edit the include file, and all your pages will show the changes. </p>

<p>I hope this make sense. You can always do a google search for 'server side includes'. There are millions of tutes out there.</p>

<p>Just a little tip for your site. Looks really good, but  I think you need to use % or em to size your text. That way visitors can change the size of the text through the browser. This is also a W3C accessibility issue.</p>

<p>Have a look at your Unordered lists. Try  matching the number of open  with the number of times you've closed them, and have a look at the  and  tags. I think you'll find you are short a few  and a lok of  tags....</p>

<p>Could someone explain the behavior of onmouseover and onmouseout?  From what I thought is:</p>

<p>when you move the mouse to a menu item A, the menu item A's onmouseover started.<br>
then when you move to menu item B, the menu item A's onmouseout activated, then followed by the menu item B's onmouseover.</p>

<p>Since some of the things I put in were repeating, I put some alert box in these functions.  It seems like it went over to onmouseout, then onmouseover, then onmouseout, then onmouseout, then onmouseover.  The sequence may be not exactly as I mentioned, but is something like that.  </p>

There are three basic menus, one vertical two horizontal.  Instead of using id for the styles i used class, with both horizontal menus having the same class.  Put all id's of menus you'd like to activate in the array at the top of the js file.<br>
My implementation works in perfectly in firefox, opera8, netscape 7,8, and ie 6, <br>
it work okay in ie5.5,5 and opera 7 ("cell" widths inconsistent),<br>
in netscape4, and ie4, you see the old style lists,<br>
and in ns 6, opera 5,6 the drop downs don't work (just a case of hiding the styles from those to get the old skool list shown instead)<br>
Hope that helps!</p>

<p>the reason that you are getting the drop down boxes over the menu is that in IE the z-index of the drop down box is set to be higher than any other element on the page.  You have to use javascript to hide and display the dropdown boxes when the menu is activated.  </p>

<p>Now on to the problem i have with your code using firefox.  It seems that the darn menu will not take exception to any zindex ordering and the ul will always appear below other divs.  I have tried everything to reverse this and I have not found a way. Whats the deal?</p>

<p>I have spent the last three nights swimming with the Suckerfish... I have been prototyping pages to see if I can integrate these menus easily.  I got a three-tier horizontal menu to work on my site as server-side - and got it to validate as strict XHTML 1.0.  </p>

<p>And it looks identical in IE6 / Firefox 1.04 / Opera 8.01.  Not yet able to check it from the Mac side.</p>

<p>Previously, I had been using frames/HTML 4.01.  By next Friday, I should be frames-free, strictly XTHML 1.0 and navigating smoothly.</p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment295"><span>Comment </span>295</a></h3>
<p>I have two things to add to this discussion of this wonderful suckerfish concept.</p>

<p>1. hiding select boxes. here is my CRUDE fix:<br>
sfHover = function() {<br>
	var sfEls = document.getElementById("nav").getElementsByTagName("li");<br>
	for (var i=0; i&lt;sfEls.length; i++) {<br>
		sfEls[i].onmouseover=function() {<br>
				sel = document.getElementsByTagName("select");<br>
				for (var i=0; i&lt;sel.length; i++) {<br>
					sel[i].style.visibility = 'hidden';				<br>
				}<br>
			this.className+=" sfhover";<br>
		}<br>
		sfEls[i].onmouseout=function() {<br>
				sel = document.getElementsByTagName("select");<br>
				for (var i=0; i&lt;sel.length; i++) {<br>
					sel[i].style.visibility = 'visible';				<br>
				}<br>
			this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp(" sfhover\\b"), "");<br>
		}<br>
	}<br>
}<br>
if (window.attachEvent) window.attachEvent("onload", sfHover);</p>

<p>Note that after the mouseover and mouseout events, I have little for loops that show/hide all select boxes on the page.</p>

<p>A more intelligent solution would be to to measure x and y coords of dropdowns and only show/hide select boxes whose own x.y coords interseect..kapish?</p>

<p><br>
2. switching direction  of submenus. problem: for wide menus, submenus extend off the right-hand edge of the page and are inaccessible. what happens is the page's scrollbar jumps out to accomodate expanded submenu. but when you mouseoff said submenu (in order to move scrollbar over manually), the scrollbar jumps back. for many designs which have a top-level menu of a widht of 760 or more (www.unausa.org) this is a major problem. here is my CRUDE solution, which assumes that ul menus have to be dynamically generated via  content management system:</p>

<p>function switchLast(){<br>
var ulNodeList = document.getElementsByTagName("ul");<br>
var ulClassNameArray = new Array();<br>
	for (i=0;i&lt;ulNodeList.length;i++) 	{	<br>
		if (ulNodeList[i].className=="one") 	{<br>
			 ulClassNameArray.push(ulNodeList[i]);		<br>
		}<br>
	}				<br>
							<br>
var subUlNodeList = ulClassNameArray[ulClassNameArray.length-1].getElementsByTagName("ul");<br>
	for (i=0;i&lt;subUlNodeList.length;i++)	{<br>
		subUlNodeList[i].style.margin = '0 0 0 -186'; 	<br>
	}<br>
}</p>

<p><br>
Works fine in IE and FF on PC. </p>

<p>I'm having a very bizarre problem in IE6. I used the old Suckerfish Menu system and all was well. I decided to clean up the code and upgrade to Sons of Suckerfish, and now IE is rendering the dropdowns to the right of each category name rather than underneath (like they do in every other browser I've tested on). I've tried clearing, margins, positions, padding, even text sizes. Nothing I do fixes this.</p>

<p>Granted, the drop down menus, for all intents and purposes, function. I'm just afraid it will confuse the users and I really want this site's functionality to be as high as an amateur such as myself can accomplish. </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I have discovered that IE6 hates both the absolute positioning AND the left: auto bits of this code. Another strange thing I've observed is that when I suck the CSS out of this menu, FF and Opera render the unordered lists OVER the content and IE6 streches the navbar to accomodate the UL. Isn't that the Windows way?</p>

<p>How do I work around this? I'd like to understand the mechanics behind everything. :)</p>

<p>RE: 305 </p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>

<p>Yes, this can be implemented using a class selector instead of an id one. Caveat: If you're using it in a dynamically generated table (as I am) you'll get mouseover/out problems on the menus which exceed the table's bottom row on the screen. In addition you'll have transparency/z-index problems with elements that appear directly below the containing table.</p>

<p>Ah. Now to post it correctly. In my excitement, I forgot to read the guidelines for posting!</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've resolved my little SoSF menu problem. It had nothing to do with CSS, as I had originally thought.</p>

<p>Basically, it boiled down to the top-level menu. For each category "About Us" "Divisions" etc., I'd simply not added an anchor. It worked with the old system, and FF, Opera, and Netscape rendered the thing correctly. It validated and seemed logical to me. I didn't want to have to fiddle with the way the text turned blue when someone moused over the top-level.</p>

<p>That'll teach me.</p>

<p>you have to put a high z-index on the #nav ul li itself (the parent li)  ie sometimes gets confused and thinks that the drop-down menu ul is just part of the li, and screws up the z-indexing.</p>

<p>I am having trouble with the suckerfish drop downs. I've included pictures of the IE problems (the 1st pic) and FF problems (the 2nd pick). In IE everything looks ok, except the dropdown is transparent. I've tried changing z-indexes but can't get anything to work. Another problem (not shown in the picture) is when I hover over the last link in the dropdown, the next column is also highlighted. So, my top level UL is Home Services About Us. Services has a drop down menu, and when I hover over the last item in the drop down menu, and it changes, so does about us, like they are 1 item.  I'll also include my css and the html for the dropdowns. If anyone has any help, could you please email me? It's been driving my crazy trying ot figure this out.  </p>

<p>I have a problem with the suckerfish dropdowns though. They lag in IE6 / WinXP SP2. The mouseover effect is really bad in some cases, where they work prefectly in FF for instance. I have a testcase up at <a href="http://www.assimilated.dk/cssmenu-testcase/">http://www.assimilated.dk/cssmenu-testcase/</a> - I hope one of you guys can supply a solution. As far as I can see though, this is a genereal problem with the Suckerfish menues, as I can see examples like <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/example/">http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/example/</a> also suffer from the same problem (and the example in the original SF article at A list apart).</p>

<p>If it becourse IE is running the jscript each time a :hover command is needed? Is there somehow to cache the effect? Anyways, hope somebody can shed some light on this.</p>

<p>RE 337 - IE img hover lag</p>

<p>I believe your IE "lag" is caused by the image loading -at the time of the hover-. Netscape 6 or so may suffer from this problem as well.</p>

<p>A possible solution - Load N' Hold - load (thus cache) the image behind something/hidden elsewhere. Also, give your hover a similar background color vs. no background color; effect may diminish<br>
Or Filter Opacity? although, this (most likely) would involve some kind of JSTF (JavaScript  tom-foolery)</p>

<p>hmm, I just tried your menu with Moz and FF, and it lags as well. Personally, I wouldn't worry about it. The menu works better than most of mine! ;P<br>

<p>Hi Kristofer</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I actually found the problem though.</p>

<p>It was a IE6 only issue. It seems that IE6, when Internet Options -&gt; Tempoary Internet Files -&gt; Settings is set to "Every visit to the page", reloads the image on when a background image from the server on every mouse over. That makes for a lot of reloads when you move the mouse over a menu such as mine. To make it worse, this setting seems to be the default setting, for computers joined to a domain, which most corporate computers are.</p>

<p>The solution sucks, but it works. On a Apache server, you can put the following in your .htaccess file (or Apache config if you have access to it):</p>

<p><br>
#this stops screen flicker in IE<br>
BrowserMatch "MSIE" brokenvary=1<br>
BrowserMatch "Mozilla/4.[0-9]{2}" brokenvary=1<br>
BrowserMatch "Opera" !brokenvary<br>
SetEnvIf brokenvary 1 force-no-vary<br>
ExpiresActive On<br>
ExpiresDefault A18000<br>
ExpiresByType image/gif A86400</p>

<p><br>
This will tell IE6 that all gif images in that folder where the .htaccess file resides, wont be modified for 24 hours, which will make IE NOT try to download the image at mouse over again (I use gif's in my menus, change the last line appropriately if you use another image type).</p>

<p>I also applied the "Pixy No Preload method, which help make the menus even more responsive in IE as well.</p>

<p>fss has a excellent article on how to minimize the flicker problem, that’s worth checking out as well.</p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment348"><span>Comment </span>348</a></h3>
<p>I am completely confused on how to get this blasted thing to work right.  I'm trying to force it to have the submenus popup horizontally rather than vertically, as my main menu is vertical,  but I just can't seem to get it to work right.  In other words, I want it to be like this:</p>

<p>List Item 1<br>
List Item 2 &gt; Submenu List Item 1<br>
List Item 3    Submenu List Item 2<br>
List Item 4    Submenu List Item 3<br>
.                      Submenu List Item 4<br>
.                      .<br>
.                      .<br>
.                      .</p>

<p>Sorry to keep spamming, but I just removed my own CSS, copied and pasted the CSS used for the vertical varient, changed some of  it (nothing major, font color, background color, and some minor margin changes to keep everything looking pretty), and it still won't work properly in either Firefox or Opera.  And this is using the same exact code (again, except for some minor, non critical beautification changes) that the vertical example uses.  The example works fine in all my browsers.  My web site falls apart in everything but IE.  What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Our big site's going live at the end of September, probably on the 29th.  <br>
I'll post the address here as soon as it's live.<br>
It uses the SoS menu structure,  and works on Windows with IE, Mozilla, Netscape and Opera.  For Mac fans it works on IE, Netscape and Safari.  It also deals with the problem seen when the menu falls over a combo box in IE.  Also, the width of the top level menu items are built dynamically based on the text size of each item;  the server creates a custom style for each.  The entire page was built on the server side using JSP.  That is why the source code looks so disjointed.  <br>
So as you pick it apart, it might be worth knowing that I'm a Java developer.  The last time I created a website was about seven years ago.  I've never used CSS before this project.</p>

<p>See how handy this menu structure is?</p>

<p>Thanks you guys!  I owe the authors, the guys who posted their questions and the guys who provided the answers.</p>

<p>One major bug appears on all the suckerfish menu - after linking to a page from a drop down menu press the back button (on safari or IE mac) and the drop down menu is still there. This isn't too bad except that on IE 5 mac the menu never goes away!? it's just left stuck on screen. This is a bad bug as it makes the menu unusable on IE5 mac if people press the back button. It also happens with ALL suckerfish menus currently available online.</p>

<p>Hey Ofi - keep an eye out for the site I mentioned in post 352.  My partner Jenny built an iFrame that's the same size as the submenu and it appears (behind the submenu) only when you mouseover the submenu.  The iFrame gets built all the time but the onmouseover events on the links only get built for IE.  Make sure you provide a 'blank.html' page for the source so you don't get hinky security boxes.  I can't see the code right now since I'm on the Mac, but when my site's up you can snag the source code.</p>

<p>SeriousGeorge here, and as you can see, I am mere days away from replacing a major client's gigantic, massively script-heavy DHTML menu with Son of a Suckerfish.</p>

<p>Note that I have the direction switch I posted in #295 working.</p>

<p>This menu is working great in every 5.0+ browser, including Opera, Mac NS, Mac Safari, etc. Buuut, although it works in Mac IE 5, it's not working great. It's taking a very long time to "load" any  submenu when mousing over its respective  parent Node.</p>

<p>What is happening in essence, is that it's taking a long time to apply change the property of the  in question from left:-999em to left:auto</p>

<p>Anyone run into this problem and figure a solution? Thanks.</p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment358"><span>Comment </span>358</a></h3>
<p>One problem I see with using left: -999em; is that blind readers using tab to navigate from one link to the next will have to navigate through all the links, rather than just the topic of interest. So it would seem that it would be better for them to tab to the main topic of interest and follow the link to that topic (and its topic-specific links) rather than having to navigate the entire navigation menu.</p>

<p>I have incorporated the Suckerfish menu in my site framework. You can at any time switch between vertical and hortizontal menus, set the depth of the menus. The menu data is stored in a MySQL table. Every time you add a page to the site (or move it, rename it, delete it etc) the menu data is regenerated from PHP scripts. The PHP scripts recurse through the pages table, only including those pages you want to appear in the menu or sitemap. You can also set some pages as adminstrative. I am contributing them to this community in thanks for the generosity of the HTML dog authors. Get them at www.wizardinteractive.com. The specific files in the distribution are /inc/functions/store_menu_array.php (creates an array of pages and stores them in the db table) and in/functions/topMenu.php (reads the stored array and formats it as a unordered list).</p>

<p>Re: 370:</p>

<p>I've found that a *lot* of div layers and such can't be put into tables, or they don't work right.  You can use div's for styling purposes and such (like fonts and borders) - but what you're trying to do it stick something dynamic (your dropdown divs) into something static (your table) and wanting the dynamic stuff to still be that way.  It doesn't work.  It's sort of like trying to stick a cube into a paper-thin mailslot.  </p>

<p>Put your menu into a div layer *outside* of the table, and use positioning to get it where you want.  That should help.</p>

<p>I'm having 2 issues, if anyone could take a moment to help me.</p>

<p>I have a menu that needs to look and act as such:</p>

<p>Top Link 1       &lt;-- needs to be bold when any sublink is hovered<br>
  sublink 1<br>
  sublink 2<br>
  sublink 3       &lt;-- needs to keep background image *and* be bold when its sublink is hovered<br>
         sub-sublink of 3<br>
         sub-sublink of 3  &lt;--- needs to be bold and have bg image show when hovered</p>

<p>So basically, I need *all* of the links to be bold when hovered.  But if the top link menu has a dropdown showing, I need it to remain bold while someone hovers over the sublinks.  If a sublink has a sublink, I need the background to stay in the sublink while hovered over the sublink's sublink.  </p>

<p>Good Lord, I hope that made sense.  </p>

<p>Anyway, when I try to add "font-weight:bold" to the #nav li:hover, #nav li.sfhover {" spot (which would solve my "bold text" issue), the sublinks disappear altogether.</p>

<p>Oh, and if it helps, currently my stylesheet is as such:</p>

<p>#nav, #nav ul {		float: left;<br>
			list-style: none;<br>
			line-height: 1;<br>
			background:transparent;<br>
			font-size: 1.1em;<br>
			padding: 0;<br>

<p>And can the width of each drop menu equal the width of the longest text string within?</p>

<p>Or would the only reliable way to achieve this be to use images and fixed pixel width content instead of plain text links in the list items?<br>

<p>Hello,<br>
Is it possible to separate the menu, the css, and the "content" into 3 different files?  I'm trying to do this, but have not had any success yet.  I'm trying to emulate the functionality of frames, where I can load some content into a designated area.  So, I would like to have 1 file where the navigation is, and have the links just load various content into the "content" div.  Is this possible?  Should I just include the navigation on each of my gazillion pages?</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm kinda new at this.</p>

<p>@376: Yes it is possible.  You need to call the javascript in your header like so:   </p>

<p><br>
The CSS goes into your normal CSS like usual.</p>

<p>My problem:<br>
In my case the first li isn't a link.  So I removed the anchor tags and IE6 stopped working.  Instead of being below the top most element they are now to the right and slightly below (not an entire line).<br>

<p>I'm working out an interesting problem and though some of you might have a suggestion. </p>

<p>As a pretext…</p>

<p>Nav1<br>
Button1 - selected<br>
Button2 </p>

<p>Nav2<br>
Button1 <br>
Button2 - selected<br>
Etc…</p>

<p>I have 7 main pages; 1 navigation for each page but just because of the selected button. Basically every navigation is the same except for the selected button which has a background color change. I am now trying to change this to one navigation for all pages and changing the background of a selected button once it is clicked.</p>

<p>My idea is to add an asp include to define the button to be changed and add this to all my pages. So for example, mainnav = button1, mainnav = button2 etc…and if the specific include is detected then change the class of the selected item.</p>

<p>I hope I'm making sense here.</p>

<p>I have a couple ideas of how to go about doing this but if anyone has any suggestions you could really help me out.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>First of all thank you for your great work with the menu and the loyal attitude by sharing it. I hope I don't repost a question, but since the list is so big I don't have the time to read it all.<br>
I got a positioning problem with the menu. I made it first for Firefox and it all looked very nice so that's no problem, but when I opened it in IE I saw a differend result as I expected. There's an unwanted space between the UL-elements and I don't know how to remove them (without getting another result in FF). I think it has something to do with the borders, but I'm not sure. I hope someone on this site can help me.<br>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment390"><span>Comment </span>390</a></h3>
<p>I made a few hacks in the Dropdown code to fix IE bugs.</p>

<p>1. IE onLoad does not fire until all the images on the page are loaded.  Also, I modified onLoad as above.<br>
So use a MouseOver to fire up sfHover:</p>

<p>&lt;ul id="nav" onMouseOver="sfHover()"&gt;</p>

<p>and in the JavaScript, with my changed lines commented:</p>

<p>var sfdoLoad= document.all &amp;&amp; document.getElementById; // IE only, and byId required below<br>
sfHover = function() {<br>
	if (sfdoLoad) { // unless done<br>
		var sfEls = document.getElementById('nav').getElementsByTagName('LI');<br>
		if (sfEls &amp;&amp; (sfEls.length &gt; 0)) { // DOM is ready<br>
			sfdoLoad= false;  // mark done<br>
			for (var i=0; i&lt;sfEls.length; i++) {<br>
				sfEls[i].onmouseover=function() {<br>
					this.className+=" sfhover";<br>
				}<br>
				sfEls[i].onmouseout=function() {<br>
					this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp(" sfhover\\b"), "");<br>
				}<br>
			}<br>
		}<br>
	}<br>
}<br>
// fall back to body onLoad, which waits for all images to load<br>
if (document.all) { // Load sfHover only in IE; other browsers don't need it<br>
	if (window.attachEvent) window.attachEvent("onload", sfHover);<br>
	else window.onload = sfHover; // Mac IE5 needs this<br>
}<br>
//</p>

<p><br>
The first MouseOver (before onLoad) still won't work, but after that they all do.<br>
To really fix it for IE, you could  write a simpler handler...<br>
  function simp(elem,act) { if (document.all) { elem.className= act ? 'sfhover' : '' }}<br>
(I've assumed no other classes apply, for simplicity)...<br>
and add to *every* LI tag:<br>
  onMouseOver="simp(this,true)" onMouseOut="simp(this,false)"<br>
Then you don't need onLoad or sfHover at all, but it clutters up the html and fires a lot of events.</p>

<p><br>
2. I'm using a vertical menu, so I wanted some overlap.  IE has a z-index bug.  As someone else mentioned, you can delete<br>
  position: relative;<br>
in "#nav li", which fixes the IE bug.  It still works in Mozilla Firefox, with two levels at least.  I don't know about the rest.</p>

<p><br>
3. Slight positioning errors in IE, as someone else mentioned.  Also, if you remove the first line<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt;<br>
then the positioning changes in Firefox.<br>
So I changed some numbers in the style sheet, and it looks good for what I'm doing.<br>

<p>I don't believe we should be using id="nav" is being used rather than class="nav". I think we can agree that the semantically correct way to store a list of site links  would be through the  tags, the only problem being is that most of the times my websites hold more than one set of links, e.g. I usually have a set of header, menu and footer links. The way I store these links are: ,, etc.</p>

<p>In order to support multiple navigation links on the same page, I've had to modify the javascript slightly, for those who are interested:</p>

<p>if (window.attachEvent) window.attachEvent("onload", function() {<br>
  try {<br>
  var lists = document.getElementsByTagName("UL");<br>
  for (var i=0; i</p>

<p>#menu .nav, #menu .nav ul { /* all lists */<br>
  padding: 0;<br>
  margin: 0;<br>
  list-style: none;<br>

<p>hello. i am a self-trained, that is to say not trained, website designer wannabe. i have had a self-promotional website for a couple of years, and recently tried to update it with new portfolio images and better navigation using ideas from the suckerfish dropdown article. thansk for sharing your expertise. i am so pleased with the results - it is a much easier to use website now. the problem, however, is that it only functions correctly in safari. in every other browser i’ve tried, either the dropdowns malfunction, the images disappear, or the images rearrange themselves. </p>

<p>if anyone could help me fix this problem, i would be happy to offer free garden advice for life. i am much more skilled in horticulture than html. if you’re interested in taking a look, please visit <a href="http://www.juliewallingford.com/">http://www.juliewallingford.com.</a></p>

<p> don't believe we should be using id="nav" is being used rather than class="nav". I think we can agree that the semantically correct way to store a list of site links would be through the tags, the only problem being is that most of the times my websites hold more than one set of links, e.g. I usually have a set of header, menu and footer links. The way I store these links are: ,, etc.</p>

you haven't got any css up on there that i can see... which is what this is all about...<br>
just doing an unordered list is going to be like what you have...<br>
you need to add the sf hover javascript to the  part of your html page and you need to put the css stuff either into the head of your html page or in a seperate .css file that you call with  or whatever...</p>

<p>Thanks for demonstrating this. I'm terribly frustrated with IE 6.0 right now. When I put two seperate drop-down menues on the page, each in a seperate div tag, Firefox displays them just fine. IE will only display the first one listed in the code. I've played with the Z values, but am baffled. (Perhaps a fresh set of eyes will see the obvious problem.)</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of this suckerfish concept. It's been an extremely handy tool since the day it was first introduced. However I'm *not* a big fan of cluttering my CSS with the ridiculous selectors required for anything beyond a 3 tier dropdown. I think we can all agree that:</p>

<p>#nav li:hover ul, #nav li li:hover ul, #nav li li li:hover ul, #nav li.sfhover ul, #nav li li.sfhover ul, #nav li li li.sfhover ul</p>

<p>is absurd, and the requisite addendums to your stylesheet become increasingly nastier as your menu deepens--making dynamic suckerfish implementations a dreadful mess.</p>

<p>Instead, I suggest you follow the tutorial to this point:</p>

<p>#nav li ul {<br>
	position: absolute;<br>
	width: 10em;<br>
	left: -999em;<br>
}</p>

<p>and then utilize the following javascript, which simply attaches a mouseover/mouseout function to each LI. These simply change the style.left property of any child UL.</p>

<p>function fixMenu(){<br>
  x = document.getElementById('nav');<br>
  y = x.getElementsByTagName('li');<br>
  for(var i=0; i&lt;y.length; i++){<br>
    y[i].onmouseover = function(){<br>
      var ul = this.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0];<br>
      if(ul) ul.style.left = "auto";<br>
    }<br>
    y[i].onmouseout = function(){<br>
      var ul = this.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0];<br>
      if(ul) ul.style.left = "-999em";<br>
    }<br>
  }<br>
}</p>

<p>And whammo! Make your menu as deep as you like without adding a single selector. Delicious cross-browser compatibility too.</p>

<p>Great code. I built a horizontal list starting from Nick Rigby's article, but the dropdowns didn't work consistently. Found this js code, and with the tweaks by posters Anatoly and Simeon, got it to work even in Mac IE (tho the current selection disappears as it links). Thanks, all!</p>

<p>Couple comments for others:<br>
--Post 386: a little unclear on the question. If you want the section (top most level of the menu) to be highlighted when you are in any page of that section, you could add a class or a body id function.</p>

<p>-- Post 408: this nav is an exact replica of Eric Sheperds article re hybrid cc dropdowns on ALA site.</p>

<p>-- To use this code you will need to either be familiar with css or willing to become so. Everything about css is customizable --  but it takes patience to figure out where that happens. </p>

<p>-- if you're worried about multiple drop down menus per page, I urge you to reconsider the problem. It might not be that the functionality of this code is wrong, but that the navigation systems need to be re-thought out. <br>

<p>On the topic of SuckerFish dropdowns, I recently implemented a similar version by Nick Rigby (NickRigby.com) with a Zen-Cart store currently under development.  The menu worked perfectly in the latest versions of Opera and Firefox.  IE seemed to be working perfectly as well with the Suckerfish IE "hack" code until I got to the login page for some customization work.  The submenus simply refused to appear on this page.  As previously mentioned in previous posts, this is due to IE's handling of forms.  I swapped in csshover.htc that I got from DrByte's CSS Flyout Menu contribution at Zen-Cart.org and everything appears to work just fine in IE. </p>

<p>I really like the Suckerfish code, primarily due to its small size.  But this problem with IE forms must be addressed.  If anyone has a quick fix of maybe two lines or so I'd certainly like to know.  Please contact me by email if you find a good, concise solution.</p>

<p>is anyone able to tell me the easiest and most simplistic way of making mt 2nd level menu items adjust according to the length of text? Unfortunately if they are too long, it puts the word on the next line, but the odd thing is, is it seems there plenty of space for it to fit. Its like theres an invisible line cutting it off. </p>

<p>Ive played around for hours but cant fix it.</p>

<p>Also the fact that you cant resize the width of the top level menu items is a bit annoying, but i guess i can deal with it.</p>

<p>I saw a few questions and no responses about some things. </p>

<p>1. Breaking the menu in to multiple pages: Easily done, though you'll have 4 files total. css, js, html, js  the jscript is broken in to two different sections. The only way I know of to call separate files is to be using a web progamming language, and the only one I know is PHP using the include() function. So if I did it, the HTML would be a PHP file, say menu.php  It would first call the css info  include('menu.css'); then the first js  include('js1.js');  and then you have your list tags and data  then  include('js2.js');   </p>

<p>2. A true Dynamic menu has to be db driven IMO. Otherwise, you're still having to modify page code to make changes. Again, in PHP, I fardled around until I could make the output source for my finished product match the same template as the current suckerfish example. Most of that is telling your scripting language when to put a linebreak  in PHP that's \n   If you don't know what I'm talking about, you should probably pick up some intro books in to whatever db and web language you're trying to do this in, cuz it's also very basic stuff, just sometimes confusing logic threads</p>

<p>I am having a bit of problem with the secondary list displaying behind my div#content, the &lt;div&gt; has "clear: left;" set so I'm not sure why it's not working.</p>

<p>This was happening in both IE6 and Firefox. I tried to fix this by adding a z-index value to "#nav, #nav ul" - this solved the problem in Firefox but not IE6.</p>

<p>Current CSS code (other than default Suckerfish code plus a few styles) is:</p>

<p>div#main<br>
{<br>
	position: relative;<br>
	float: left;<br>
	clear: left;<br>
	z-index: 10;<br>
	margin: 12px;<br>
	padding: 12px;<br>
	width: 900px;<br>
	border: 1px solid #444;<br>
	background-color: #578;<br>
	color: #fff;<br>
}</p>

<p>div#content<br>
{<br>
	line-height: 1.3em;<br>
	margin: 20px 12px;<br>
	display: block;<br>
	text-align: left;<br>
	width: 870px;<br>
	position: relative;<br>
	clear: left;<br>
	float: left;<br>
}</p>

<p>Is it because I have positioned things relatively with float etc., that's the only reason I can think of.<br>
Suggestions anyone? Thanks in advance...</p>

<p>Just to let everyone know, I just found a solution.</p>

<p>The &lt;div&gt; tag that the nav was styled as below:</p>

<p>position: relative; <br>
float: left; </p>

<p>IE6 dislikes having the the div &lt;div&gt; positioned but to help with consistency of the background-color in the whole of the main &lt;div&gt; I added </p>

<p>html &gt; div#left {position: relative; float: left; }</p>

<p>which on IE6 does not recognise, allowing the navigation to display in front of the text in both IE6 and Firefox!</p>

<p>Really impressed with this menu however I have cross browser issues.  I'm using the menu where it overlaps a div to the right of it.  The div has a style of overflow: auto.  I have the menu set up as a vertical menu.  I set the menu to have position of absolute with z-index:10 so that it layers above other divs.  The menu displays when you hover over the first level buttons but as soon as you roll into the secondary menu which overlaps the div, the menu disappears.  The problem is the overflow:auto which needs to be in the div but if you take overflow:auto out, the menu works.</p>

<p>The menu currently does not work in Netscape 7.2 and Firefox 1.0.7.<br>
It works on IE, Firefox 1.5.0.1, and Safari.</p>

<p>If anyone has any solutions, let me know.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, <br>
I just want to contribute for everyone who's got a problem with the sukerfish menu and some PNG overlapping in IE.</p>

<p>If you use an alpha fix on any png background on your page, u will need the "div#content* { position:relative }" to access links...etc. Since you've done that, and if you have a suckerfish menu, (which was my case), the dropdown will automaticly go underneath every single div element on your page.</p>

<p>I tried many z-index tricks, but nothing really efficient. too bad, and then i saw a post on the nickrigby.com version quite interresting in fact.<br>
So, the solution :</p>

<p>In your suckerfish javascript :<br>
this.className+=�� sfhover��;<br>
add =&gt; this.style.zIndex=100;</p>

<p>And then in your navigation list :<br>
ul#nav {<br>
z-index:999;<br>
}</p>

<p>And ur done. Thkx you guys, it helped me to fix a futher date with my suicide :)</p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment446"><span>Comment </span>446</a></h3>
<p>First, let me thank you for such a wonderful piece of code. We're currently deploying SoS in a custom CMS system and am extremely happy with the performance of the menu.</p>

<p>Integration has gone smoothly, but I have one question in regards to the menu's functionality. Is there any way to make the submenus disappear once an item has been clicked? In another words, is there anyway to revert the menu back to its "I don't have have any of my elements hovered over" state once an item has been selected? The reason being is that while we are using several instances of SoS for generic drop-down and vertical menus we also wish to use it in the context of "Select an item from a nested list of element to populate a text-box". The functionality is there, but the client wishes for the behavior to be like that described above.</p>

<p>I've tried several methods to solve the problem, but to no avail. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I was actually able to get the functionality that I'm looking for by adding the following event to the javascript file:</p>

<p>If the users has a larger font set in their browser, it messes up the formatting of the boxes.  I had it looking great, but then when I changed the font to 'largest' 2 or my main boxes were forced under the others ones, because there wasn't any room left in the container div.</p>

I'd like the popup menus to stay visible for a second after mouseout, to allow for slight slips of the mouse.  This comes in useful when you have several levels of menu lists.

<p>The solution is the cognisance that getElementsByTagName does not consider sub elements. So this would be the appropriate function:</p>

<p>sfHover = function() {<br>
	var ulnodes = document.getElementById("menu").getElementsByTagName("ul");<br>
	for (var i=0; i&lt;ulnodes.length; i++) {<br>

		for (var n=0; n&lt;linodes.length; n++) {<br>
			linodes[n].onmouseover=function() {			this.className+=" sfhover";		}<br>
			linodes[n].onmouseout=function() {			this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp(" sfhover\\b"), "");		}<br>

<p>Very nice site, well designed and very clean.</p>

<p>Jeff,</p>

<p>No timeouts here, but you could overlap the menus slightly to get rid of the mouse slipups problem.</p>

<p>Everyone else,</p>

<p>If you're having trouble with menus going under select elements, I have a solution with instructions and examples at <a href="http://tanny.ica.com/ica/tko/tkoblog.nsf/dx/select-tag-overlap-in-ie-part-ii">http://tanny.ica.com/ica/tko/tkoblog.nsf/dx/select-tag-overlap-in-ie-part-ii</a></p>

<p>Unlike the previous version from two years ago from October 2004, this version supports nested menus. It uses the Suckerfish dropdowns example with select elements added for test cases.</p>

It works fine in FF and the main menu displays the same in IE but it just wont show the submenus when hovered over. I assumed this must be a problem with the javascript but I just cant figure it out.

<p>I took a look at the source and styles.css file and noticed that the sfHover function is adding behavior that sets the className to " sfHover", but that your css is looking for li.over when it should be looking for li.sfhover. Change the css uto use li.sfhover.</p>

<p>For everyone above who was looking to implement a delay in their Suckerfish menu, here's a solution:</p>

<p>First, grab this nice OO Timer function from <a href="http://www.codingforums.com/showthread.php?t=10531.">http://www.codingforums.com/showthread.php?t=10531.</a> It essentially solves the problem of losing scope with setTimeout.</p>

<p>Then, in your onmouseout function, replace </p>

<p>this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp("\\bsfhover\\b"), "");</p>

<p>with</p>

<p>this.timer = new Timer(this);<br>
this.timer.setTimeout("out",500);</p>

<p>Finally, create a new function to handle the timed behavior:</p>

<p>sfEls[i].out=function() {<br>
                this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp("\\bsfhover\\b"), "");<br>
}</p>

<p>Of course, since you're now using Javascript to handle the hover functionality, you need to add support for Firefox. You can do that by adding:</p>

<p>if (window.addEventListener) window.addEventListener( "load", sfHover, false );</p>

<p>Voila, Suckerfish con delay! I hope this helps others out. So far I've only tested it in Firefox (1.5) and IE6.</p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment480"><span>Comment </span>480</a></h3>
<p>Hey Joel (and anyone else that is interested)</p>

<p>About the IE7 problem about the menu getting stuck.  I got some help from a guy named Justin and I thought I would pass it on:</p>

<p>"Find the line:</p>

<p>#nav li:hover ul, #nav li.sfhover ul {left: auto; }</p>

<p>Basically that is:<br>
#nav li:hover ul { left: auto; }<br>
#nav li.sfhover ul  { left: auto; }</p>

<p>The problem in IE 7 is the first line... so I would suggest in a server side script you control who gets the first line.. I'm using asp.net 2.0  so I used code like this:</p>

<p>If Request.Browser.Browser="IE" and Request.Browser.MajorVersion &gt;= 7 Then<br>
	Response.Write("#nav li.sfhover ul {left: auto; }") Else<br>
	Response.Write("#nav li:hover ul, #nav li.sfhover ul {left: auto;<br>
}")<br>
End If</p>

<p>"</p>

<p>I don't know asp, so I found this niffty article that I used at <a href="http://www.stylegala.com/articles/no_more_css_hacks.htm">http://www.stylegala.com/articles/no_more_css_hacks.htm</a></p>

<p>It seems to work for me, hope it helps...</p>

<p>This is great, thanks. I have it working on a menu bar in IE without problems. However, it's not working correctly in Firefox.</p>

<p>Here's a description of the problem.<br>
I have a page that is three tables stacked. First a logo table, followed by a Nav Bar in a table, followed by a content table. So, 3 stacked tables. Everything is in it's place.<br>
But, when I put the &amp;lt,UL id=nav&amp;lt,tag and closing tag before and after the nav bar table Firefox displays the content table on top of the nav bar as if the nav table didn't exist. </p>

<p>I've tried moving aroud the &amp;lt,ul id=nav&amp;lt, tags inside the nav bar table instead of outside of it, but that doesn't work at all. </p>

<p>IE shows the page perfectly.</p>

<p>The URL I've posted is the problem page. It is a website underdevelopement.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any advice!</p>

<p>Sorry for the double post. But I fixed my problem. I just used one table instead of 3 nested tables. But in Firefox if you put the "ul id=nav" tag  and then the closing tag outside of a table other tables on the page ignore the table that has the "ul" tags. Firfox shows all the tables, but they overlap.</p>

<p>I have implemented the suckerfish dropdown menu on my site. It works beautifully, but I have the following problem: <br>
Some of my pages are quite heavy, so the blue 'page load progress bar' at the bottom of IE is quite an important clue for the user. However, it seems that the suckerfish JavaScript makes this bar behave abnormally. But this is the funny bit, if I hover the mouse pointer over the menu while waiting for the new page to load; the 'page load progress bar' is working correctly. </p>

<p>Is this a known issue? Is there a workaround? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>many thanks to the excellent advice from Suckerfish,  A List  Apart, and a few other sites i have been able to design CSS rollovers and multi-level dropdown menus that i'm really pleased with (it even works reasonably well in Firefox). However, i'm still experiencing one problem and i haven't been able to find a solution despite much searching and experimenting.</p>

<p>To look at the menu in question visit <a href="http://www.destinations-asia.com/menu.html">http://www.destinations-asia.com/menu.html</a>  My problem is that when you mouse over 'Information' the drop down appears - great - however it partially covers the word 'Information', design wise this does not look good. Whenever i try to move the position of the dropdown it just doesn't work.</p>

<p>MULTIPLE MENUS ON ONE PAGE</p>

<p>Just read this monstrosity, and I have yet to see a single example of live code which shows how to get "Son of Suckerfish" to work in multiple menus in Internet Explorer. (IE requires javascript to get the rollovers to work.)</p>

<p>As a recap: <br>
* In comment 396, Demis Bellot claimed he modified the javascript to make it work. This was unsuccessful for me.<br>
* In comment 284, Ant suggests putting "all id's of menus in the array at the top of js file." This didn't work.<br>
* In comment 245, JD suggests putting ul id="nav" at the top of page and including both menus within. (Did I get that right?) Don't know quite how this would work....<br>
* Also, Charles has some code in one of google's cached pages of the List Apart's comments section: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/onkxj">http://tinyurl.com/onkxj</a> <br>
I couldn't make this work either.</p>

<p>To make this not so painful, I have generated a test page:<br>
<a href="http://library.stfranciscollege.edu/test2/testmenu.htm">http://library.stfranciscollege.edu/test2/testmenu.htm</a><br>
It has two menus. Both work in Firefox, Safari, etc. but only one (always the first menu) works in IE 6.</p>

<p>Of course, if someone wants to share with me a real live working example, that would be just super too.</p>

<p>Any ideas???</p>

<p>Paul,</p>

<p>Using the original suckerfish code, I threw this together.  Use this as your Javascript file (works work both in .html, or in separate .js file; note that both sfHover, both sfhover (sfhover doesn't need the 1 if you want the menus to look/act the same), and nav have a one added at the end.  Part of the reason is that all id's ie.  have to be unique.  Having 2  is messing up the javascript, the whole/only reason for the java script code in the first place.</p>

<p><br>
sfHover = function() {<br>
	var sfEls = document.getElementById("nav").getElementsByTagName("li");<br>
	for (var i=0; i</p>

<p><br>
Note that your style code will look something like this if you want the menus to look the same:</p>

<p>#nav ul , #nav1 ul {<br>
	margin: 0;<br>
	padding: 0;<br>
	list-style: none;<br>
	width: 150px; /* Width of Menu Items */<br>
	border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;<br>
	}</p>

<p>#nav ul li, #nav1 ul li  {<br>
	position:relative;<br>
	}</p>

<p>#nav ul li a, #nav1 ul li a  {<br>
	display: block;...................</p>

<p>or this, if you want them to look different (make sure all #nav 1 li:shover1 {note the 1's}):</p>

<p>#nav ul  {<br>
	margin: 0;<br>
	padding: 0;<br>
	list-style: none;<br>
	width: 150px; /* Width of Menu Items */<br>
	border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;<br>
	}</p>

<p>#nav1 ul  {<br>

To drop just the menu down add the following code to the #dmenu ul section in your css</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>This is a great menu !! thanks for the work !</p>

<p>However I have a minor problem, the display of level 2 is very slow (IE problem only,  the problem does not show up under firefox or opera), my guess is that it's due to the number of entries of the menu that make it pretty heavy. <br>
 <br>
I think this issue was already raised by Andrew (post 117), are you aware of any solution to this ? It's not really blocking but would be nice if I could solve this slowlyness.</p>

<p>Great menu system. I am having one issue, tho.</p>

<p>In IE when the page first loads, the menu display in the upper left hand corner of the screen. However, when you do a mouse over, it moves to the proper position. This does not happen if I am use Opera to view the same page.</p>

<p>The address of the site I am working on is: <a href="http://tecg.org/">http://tecg.org.</a></p>

<p>Be warned the site is geared to the adult population.</p>

<p>thanks for the help</p>

<p>Awsome approach to menuing, and a great tutorial, so thanks guys.</p>

<p>One stupid question though - i'm trying to do the entire menu in two colours, and although the background stays its mousover colour when the submenu pops up and the mouse has moved down to select the next link, i cannot get the text to remain its mouseover colour - it reverts to the original colour, and since the menu is only two colours is invisible. Any ideas how to sort this?</p>

<p>This may be a silly question but I'm having an issue and not great with CSS. On the "looking prettier" example <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/example/">http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/example/</a> if I modify the "Anabantoidei" heading for example, making it longer and adding spaces in then it will wrap the text to occupy 2 lines over a certain character limit.</p>

<p>I'm trying to remove this effect, I've managed to resize boxes to leave plenty of room, but still the text wraps onto the next line instead leaving oodles of room being unused. Any idea how to solve this?</p>

<p>Here's a little enhancement to the great Suckerfish menu:</p>

<p>If you want to use SF menu to either reload elements on the page (by changing display or do a real DOM manipulation), or if you want to load pages in a different frame or window, you need to add the blur() function to the click handler of the A elements in the menu in order to have IE Win remove the focus from them after clicking; otherwise they stick in their <br>
:active state until any other element on the page is clicked. Just add the following lines to your sf menu.js file:</p>

<p>sfBlur = function(sfEls) {<br>
	for (var i=0; i&lt;sfEls.length; i++) {<br>
		sfEls[i].onclick = function() {this.blur()}; <br>
	}<br>
}</p>

<p>suckerfish(sfBlur,'a','nav');</p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment507"><span>Comment </span>507</a></h3>
<p>I disagree with this part of the article:</p>

<p>"CSS specs say that top, right, bottom and left values should offset an absolutely positioned box from its containing block. But unfortunately Opera decides to offset absolutely positioned boxes in relation to the page"</p>

<p>This seems correct behaviour by Opera. See the following:</p>

<p>"The containing block for a positioned box is established by the nearest positioned ancestor (or, if none exists, the initial containing block, as in our example). " - 9.8.4 Absolute positioning - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#q29">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#q29</a></p>

<p>"An element is said to be positioned if its 'position' property has a value other than 'static'." - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#position-props">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#position-props</a></p>

<p>"'position<br>
Value:  	static | relative | absolute | fixed | inherit <br>
Initial:  	static" - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#choose-position">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#choose-position</a></p>

<p>As you can see the default value for an element's position property is 'static'. If you don't set the parent of the node you're trying to absolutely position to something other than the default 'static' then rendering should be relative to the "initial containing block" and "The root of the document tree generates a box that serves as the initial containing block for subsequent layout."</p>

<p>It may appear that it should render relative to *any* block level element if you read <br>
"In general, generated boxes act as containing blocks for descendant boxes;" - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#containing-block">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#containing-block</a><br>
in the intro, miss the "In general", and fail to read the detail.</p>

<p>In fact "9.8.4 Absolute positioning" actually demonstrates the process, by adding "position: relative;" (without any top, left, etc.) to an outer block , to turn that outer block into a containing block.</p>

<p>This is where I ruin any chance of respectability :S by saying I haven't tried it - but I suggest trying to add "position: relative;" to the parent of the absolutely positioned element and seeing if Opera will deal with it.</p>

<p>Here's hoping .......</p>

<p>For those who want to use more than one menu on a page you will have to modify the javascript and CSS code slightly. Right now the javascript code looks for a specific element  &lt;ul id="nav"&gt;.</p>

<p>var sfEls = document.getElementById("nav").getElementsByTagName("LI");</p>

<p>In your HTML Change the ULs that you want to use as a menu to use &lt;ul class="nav"&gt;<br>
In the CSS change every single #nav in the CSS to .nav or ul.nav.</p>

<p>Modify the javascript code as follows:</p>

<p>function getElementsByClassName(strClassName, strTagName, oElm){<br>
	if(oElm == null)<br>
		oElm = document;<br>
	if(strTagName == null)<br>
		strTagName = "*";</p>

<p>	var arrElements = (strTagName == "*" &amp;&amp; oElm.all)? oElm.all : oElm.getElementsByTagName(strTagName);<br>
	var arrReturnElements = new Array();<br>
	strClassName = strClassName.replace(/\-/g, "\\-");<br>
	var oRegExp = new RegExp("(^|\\s)" + strClassName + "(\\s|$)");<br>
	var oElement;<br>
	for(var i=0; i&lt;arrElements.length; i++){<br>
		oElement = arrElements[i];		<br>
		if(oRegExp.test(oElement.className)){<br>
			arrReturnElements.push(oElement);<br>
		}	<br>
	}<br>
	return (arrReturnElements)<br>
}</p>

<p>sfHover = function() {<br>
	// Get all UL tags with a class of "nav"<br>
	var sfULs = getElementsByClassName("nav", "ul");<br>
	for(var iULs=0; iULs&lt;sfULs.length; iULs++){<br>
		var sfEls = sfULs[iULs].getElementsByTagName("LI");<br>
		for (var i=0; i&lt;sfEls.length; i++) {<br>
			sfEls[i].onmouseover=function() {<br>
				this.className+=" sfhover";<br>
			}<br>
			sfEls[i].onmouseout=function() {<br>
				this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp(" sfhover\\b"), "");<br>
			}<br>
		}<br>
	}<br>
}<br>
if (window.attachEvent) window.attachEvent("onload", sfHover);</p>

<p>Or you can just go over to <a href="http://tanny.ica.com/ica/tko/tkoblog.nsf/dx/select-tag-overlap-in-ie-part-iii">http://tanny.ica.com/ica/tko/tkoblog.nsf/dx/select-tag-overlap-in-ie-part-iii</a> and pick up the lastest version of iehover-fix.js which also solves the SELECT tag overlap problem.<br>

<p>I'm sorry, this isn't a javascript question, more of a CSS question to do with the SOS dropdown. I had my SOS working quite nicely in IE6, but it has recently messed up for some reason. It appears when I rollover, but when I try to move my mouse down to the menu items in the dropdown, it disappears. I believe this is because the only area in which the dropdown is being "hovered" over is the actual text, and not a div, and because of the padding around the words in the original menu, there seems to be a space of "no hover" in between the menu li and the menu li ul's which the dropdown assumes a rollout has occured. If this is confusing, take a look: www.umedplans.com/index2.php. The only dropdown is for "Products." Does anyone have any idea which of the css items I should be altering to increase the rollover area of the dropdown menu item?</p>

<p>P.S. It is working in FF, but I am running a separate style sheet for IE. www.umedplans.com/css/iehacks.css</p>

<p>It's because you're saying "right, the stuff in between the opening and closing a tags make a link." So if you've got another a element in there, then you'll have a link in a link, which just doesn't work - not only on a practical level, but on a semantic level (because it doesn't make sense how one link could be part of another).</p>

<p>The Suckerfish dropdowns don't actually have nested a elements - just nested ul and li elements.</p>

<p>hi and thanks for this - really cool.</p>

<p>i was noticing these wi\dth prperties and stuff in the css of your 'nice' examples of dropdowns - found out what it was all about. but anyway i think i got this working without all those hacks so it works in IE and Firefox, and the drop-downs have padding etc, and it displays correctly ( i think ).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jackar.com/corporate_profile_retail.htm">http://www.jackar.com/corporate_profile_retail.htm</a> </p>

<p>view that page in IE or Ffox - the Corporate Profile nav button has a dropdown and it should render identically on either browser.</p>

<p>heres the gist of the CSS, there probably is some unnecessary stuff in there because i was experimenting to make the nav look the same in IE and Ffox without using hacks.</p>

<p>Sorry, that should have said: "is positioned below the last item in the top level menu".</p>

<p>an example can be seem at <a href="http://millers-musketeers.co.uk/shop/Catalogue/SizeCharts.jsp">http://millers-musketeers.co.uk/shop/Catalogue/SizeCharts.jsp</a></p>

<h3><a href="000050.php.html#comment528"><span>Comment </span>528</a></h3>
<p>For the Flash/Safari issue (where the dropdown is hidden behind a trasparent flash object in Safari) can anyone suggest how to hide the  that contains the flash movie when you hover over specfic menu items?  I've tried modifying the 12 line JS to hide the  with visibility:hidden (using getElementById) and while it works in Firefox and IE, it doesnt work in Safari, the only one I need to work with in the first place.  </p>

<p>I was hoping to detect Safari and then only hide the Flash containing  on hover of specific s that cover the movie...any JS whizkids out there have any suggestions?</p>

<p>To fix the Flash issue, I iusually take the menu itself and place it in a layer with a z-index of 99 and then place each menu item on that same z-index.</p>

<p>Overkill is making sure the flash / other objects are in a z-index much lower.</p>

<p>The code works fine in IE but with Firefox rolling over a link brings the menu out and it stays there; moving the mouse away doesn't close the menu.</p>

<p>Any other suggestions for the IE7 permanant hover bug? Using a server side conditional isn't very practical.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, I am actually having this problem since months ago, but I am still unable to solve the problem. After reading all the comments, I realise that people usually have their navigation problem in IE instead of Firefox. Currently I am using Mozilla Firefox v 1.5.0.6 and IE version 6.0. May I know why is it that my drop down menu is working perfectly fine in IE and not in Mozilla Firefox? In Mozilla Firefox, the links do not hide at all. It's all shown out and making my site in a mess. <br>
Can anyone please kindly help me with this. I am very desperate for the solution. Thank you!</p>

<p>My navigation looks something like this:<br>
Home    <br>
About Us                                     <br>
 - History<br>
 -Committee<br>
       - <br>
       - <br>
News</p>

<p>In IE, the sub menu and sub-sub menu hides well, but in Mozilla Firefox, it just show as it is.</p>

<p>My css:</p>

<p>Sorry dudes. As amused as I am by the billions of comments, there's just too much spam to keep me this side of Planet Tolerance. So no more.</p>
