<h1>The Redesign</h1>
	
<h2>Monday 16 February, 2004 (11:16AM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p><img src="../images/redesign.gif" width="203" height="107" alt="The HTML Dog Redesign"><strong>BAM!</strong> And here it is. The newly redesigned HTML Dog.</p>

<p>Over the next few days I'll be posting a series of entries on the Dog Blog explaining the reasons behind aspects of the redesign. I have certainly enjoyed (and learned from) reading how others came to certain design decisions and I'm hoping that discussion of this redesign will be of some interest - not only in finding out about this particular site, but also in taking the opportunity to look at some areas of web design in general. The way I see it, it's looking at something big from a smaller, familiar point-of-view. It's kind of like HTML Dog is Tom Cruise and the world of web design is Japanese cultural history.</p>

<p>Some elements of the original design remain, such as the primary navigation, the content-area style, the colour scheme (although I have been more strict, using a smaller palette) and the general minimalism. The bits that have remained survive because I think they work well. In the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3430699.stm">words of Rubens Barichello</a> this is more of an <em>evolution</em> than a <em>revolution</em>.</p>

<p>The redesign reduces bandwidth by doing away with most graphical elements and giving the CSS file liposuction. Less tangible aspects such as usability, accessibility, branding and search engine optimisation have also hopefully been improved but the catalyst for the redesign itself was the need for a third column.</p>

<h3>The Third Column</h3>

<p>The <a href="../../reference/htmltags/index.html">HTML Tag Reference</a> already employed a third column, but it didn't really fit in and I was never happy with the way it looked. It has been clear that a second level of navigation was needed elsewhere too, most notably in the <a href="../index.html">Dog Blog</a> and the forthcoming CSS Property Reference. Furthermore, a clearly defined area such as a third column could also be utilised to promote both areas of the site and external interests.</p>

<p>A three-column layout is a completely different beast to the two-column species and it was going to be difficult to force a third column into a two-column layout. A different approach was required to tame the evolving Dog.
It needed to be clear that the content of the third column was part of the particular section the user was in rather than site wide (something that I think the old Tag Reference column didn't do particularly well). Another navigation aide, the 'breadcrumb' (which I would rather call the 'You-are-here jobbo', as a breadcrumb suggests the path a user has taken to reach the current page rather than the section and subsection structure of the current page), was a logical choice to hold everything together and, as you can see now, the third column, along with the content area sits underneath it.</p>

<p>It was clear that the incorporation of a third column was going to take quite a bit of restructuring so I thought I might as well just go for it and do the whole redesign thing. As this dawned on me, other aspects were pushed into the frame and in forthcoming entries I'll address layout, branding, accessibility, usability and search engine optimisation.</p>

<p>It's taken longer than I anticipated (as these things always seem to do) and it was a case of having a long list of priorities that I completely ignored but I think the whole effort has been worth it. Please let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Great evolution! The brand has become much more defined. It is redesigns like this that are the most challenging, taking an existing design and instead of scrapping the whole thing, making it better. </p>

<p>The only changes that I might suggest now would be to make the right column a little wider and the margins on the center content a little more generous. But that's a matter of taste and liquid layout philosophy.</p>

<p>Given the choice to use a liquid layout (and not to raise that whole debate again) what resolution should we optomize a site for? This design is clearly optimized for 800x600. Would it be possible to maintain the proportions of the layout by using percentages for two or three columns, and maybe even some of the margins?</p>

<p>PTG, why don't you do what I did?<br>
Create a DHTML Drop Down menu, and one in the sidebar.<br>
If the browser can support DHTML and the DOM, remove the manual sidebar mrnu. That way everyone, including NOSCRIPT browsers can see only one menu. SFHE (<a href="http://geocities.com/dc_sfhe)">http://geocities.com/dc_sfhe)</a> uses that solution.<br>

<p>Ishmae - good point. I don't suppose rambling on about how 'this' has changed from 'that' when someone doesn't know what 'that' looked like is that informative!</p>

<p>Try this: <a href="000030.php@boxer=test.html">http://www.htmldog.com/ptg/archives/000030.php?boxer=test</a></p>

<p>Thanks for all of the (mostly) kind words, both here and from emails.</p>

<p>To answer a few questions:</p>

<p>This design *isn't* actually consciously optimised for any resolution - more about this in a future blog entry about layout.</p>

<p>I won't be dumping XHTML. It's the best choice, it's here to stay and it's not complicated, as anyone who reads the HTML Dog Guides will find out. I don't understand a point about XHTML being over-complicated followed by a suggestion to slap JavaScript all over the place. Although I wrote an article about dropdowns ( <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dropdowns/">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dropdowns/</a> ), I believe that most of the time they shouldn't be used - placing information in plain sight is more usable, dropdows inevitably hinder accessibility and from a technical point of view they are heavier and less reliable (and for consistency I don't want to offer different layouts to those that have JavaScript enabled and those that don't). Dropdowns have their place, but HTML Dog is not one of those places.</p>

<p>Never make your user go hunting for navigation - which is what dropdowns can often do.  If the user can't find it, they won't bother looking.</p>

<p>Make it clean and clear and they will find.  And used it will be.</p>

<p>I could also argue til the cows come home that XHTML is the best choice myself - personally I have yet to see one real percievable benefit of adopting it.  Instead I stick to HTML 4.01(mostly strict), but using well formed markup throughout.</p>

<p>The well-formedness is for me, the biggest benefit of XHTML in that it's in there by default (HTML 4.01 of course allowing for some sloppy practises that shouldn't be allowed in this CSS age) however until the browsers actually start dealing with XHTML properly instead of tag-soup, it's a distinction that doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>Oh yes and nice design BTW.</p>

<p>I think I prefer the dynamic menus in the original design.<br>
With the current design you have to click on the left side then the right side to navigate through the guides, which I think would get a bit annoying after awhile.<br>

<p>Changing the menu stystem of the Guides is one of the things I really wasn't sure about for a long time, but then decided it was for the best. I see what you're saying about having to move over to the other side of the screen, but the choice was made because I thought that the primary navigation column was often too long and unwieldy when another level opened up underneath 'HTML Beginner' and such. It was a tough call, but I thouht I should exploit that third column. I'll wait and see though. Who knows? I may well change my mind at some point in the future....</p>

<p>Just one question.<br>
Why are you making this whole, huge thing out of a new logo and a third column? It's hardly enough changes to post all this stuff about.<br>
Anyway, I'm redesigning as well. I'm getting rid of the drop down menu.<br>
My new column looked so nice I couldn't bare it being removed onload because of the drop downs. So I'm keeping it.<br>
Mozilla has issues with it still, but I can solve them with DHTML of all things. What a lazy person I am.</p>

<p>Dante, don't you think a bit of modesty in your posts is called for given that you keep referring people to one of the butt-ugliest sites around? Ever heard of the margin attribute? Color coordination? Style? Jeez.</p>

<p>This is an awesome site. I've learned so much from the content and the Japanese gardeness of the layout. Well done.</p>

<p>May I take a moment of your time and ask a quick question about something I just can't crack and couldn't crack before I learned xhtml/css here.</p>

<p>How do you make links light up like in your primary navigation column up there even if the mouse hovers next to them and not on the actual link text?</p>

<p>When I do it the link only highlights if the mouse is on the text and then you see the background and border and stuff. Works as it should in my central column, never works in my left and right columns.</p>

<p>I'd really appreciate somebody's help on that.</p>

<p>And again, htmldog, it's layout, content and what it stands for is a thing of beauty.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>To create a menu of links that allow hover effects beyond the text, set the CSS display property of those links to "block." The links will act like any block element, filling their parent container from edge to edge.</p>

<p>Make sure you don't apply that style to all links though! Most links should remain inline.</p>

<p>Well, the simple reson to have XHTML does not goes well with little children playing with JavaScript and violating every rool just because browser lets 'em. Ah, the reason - XHTML (well formed) will be parsed by any XML parser and is much friendlier for any sort of server-side scripting beeing that .NET, Java or PHP. And if you can parse it you have all the nifty tricks that XML and especially XSLT gives you</p>
