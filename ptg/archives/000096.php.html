<p>Andy: I guess I dont have to click on the link and I'm glad for the comments or I would have clicked on the link because up till this time I trusted this HTML Dog Blog. This type of entry takes my trust level of this site down a bunch of noches. I have sent youths to this site so that they could learn html and css. Now I'm having to re-think that policy.

<p>My thoughts exactly.</p>

<p>Maybe instead of Smart Links, the Google toolbar should append those little TV rating images to *every goddamn link* on the internet (sorry for increasing this page's rating to TV-14 with that one, but I'm sure it was already TV-MA due to that incredibly offensive link).</p>

<p>And yes, I'm being sarcastic.  I wasn't aware that Patrick was maintaining both great web standards tutorials and a babysitting website.  Very, very sad.</p>

<p>Patrick, I'm offended that you tipped me off to potentially offensive content with the label "nipple suction toys." I would rather you just use a simple "click here" and let me take my chances. Of course, I needed something to be offended about today, so thanks.</p>

<p>Dan, I always use my wife's emory board to roughen up whatever surface I intend to apply Suckerfish. The "grit" declaration in your CSS selectors will allow you to control the level of roughness.</p>

<p>Martin: hickey {color: transparent;} will fix you up.</p>

<p>Excellent drop-down solution. I'm no javascript expert, so I have a question. Is there an easy way to get these drop-downs to work with OnClick instead of onMouseover and onMouseout? I have put a search form in one of the lists and as as soon as my mouse moves off, I lose the content of the list and therefore the ability to enter the search criteria in the form. Thanks.</p>

<p>Geez, Patrick, thanks for the depth reaction. Not.</p>

<p>This turns me off completely to using what I was just thinking is a stellar resource . . .but then, we've already seen how much that feedback matters. Yeah, have a good laugh on me. A freebie. Cuz I am going elsewhere. There's no reason in the world to run into gratuitous crap like this. It stings. And oh how amusing to not acknowledge that.</p>

<p>Haha christ HTML Dog is still a stellar resource even if it's not as serious as the Financial Times.</p>

<p>Which brings me to Suckerfish Dropdowns... They're brilliant, thanks so much - saved me pages of Javascript with a standards based  interoperable solution and all that Jazz; I was just wandering if it's possible to vary the width on the second level lists (li ul)? "width: auto" just doesn't seem to work, maybe I'm just not using my head, but I've made a good attempt at trying to get it right and miserably failed.</p>

<p>Cheers in advance, anyone with a noggin... (PS are questions answered here or should i be commenting on the blog topic? Have i made a faux-pas, oh golly i do hope not).</p>

<p>Would you apologize if it were . . racist? . . I don't know you (I still think your site is outstanding) but choose something you do feel tenderly about. Something vulnerable. Are you . .Irish? Were you born is some way inherently dignified that makes you sad or angry or hurt to see the world, um, trash? How about your mum? Feel protective of her?</p>

<p>Look, I know there's an equivalent, in life, where all you guys see the point, so that to be blind as the whys are wherefore of the nipple shot is simply revealing . . of pretend-blindness. </p>

<p>It just isn't funny. Yeah, it's a way guys posture for other guys - but it's positively painful, for some of your readers, in ways you ought, by now, to have a clue. Put up a link of your own damn gender's nipple. </p>

<p>I suppose that's the issue: women are not objects. Nor are their body parts. I know, I know, this is so utterly pervasive that to protest is utterly unexpected, utterly uncool. I really don't care. It's wrong and you know it. If you wouldn't want your wife, your daughter, your mother at the other end of that link, then don't do it with any woman's picture. </p>

<p>oh, fer christ sake, number 2.....</p>

<p>first of all, the nipple shot is 2 clicks away, and if you look at it that way, 2 klicks is all that separates you from, say, google entry "sex pictures"...... or anything like that....</p>

<p>second of all, hate to be the voice of kink here, but both me and my g/f were totally awed by the link, me being a total geek, and her being a fetish freak :)<br>
so, zo, to answer your question, not only that I not wouldn't like to see my g/f on that picture, but she'd probably like that as well....... not sure about my mom, though, don't know what her preferences are........ :P</p>

<p>Zo, I don't accept it's wrong, I don't accept it's not funny (and the comments here are testament to that), it's not tantamount to racism and I don't even accept it's sexist. This is not hardcore abusive porn we're talking about here.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don't actually care about nipple suction toys, I was just amused that such a kinky device coincidentally has the same name as a CSS/JavaScript technique that I helped develop.</p>

<p>I'm completely in awe of just how blown out of proportion this entire Suckerfish thing has gotten (the nipple suction, not your fantastic CSS techniques : ).  Patrick you certainly have no reason to apologize.  You've got a good sense of humor and its a damn shame that certain people want to come on *your* blog and tell you how to run it.  I do, however, worry for Zo's health.  If she's that offended by your Suckerfish link, I can just imagine how tawdry and used a mammogram must make her feel.</p>
