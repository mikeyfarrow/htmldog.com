<h1>Hosting Dilemma</h1>
	
<h2>Wednesday 14 April, 2004 ( 9:28AM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>I've used a lot of hosting companies in the past. A LOT. And they've all been crap in one way or another, be it reliability, customer service, unwarranted demands for money / threats to sue me etc. etc.</p>

<p>They've all been crap except for one - <a href="http://www.titanhosts.net/">Titan Internet</a>. I've been using them for a few years now and it has been the home of HTML Dog since the start. I would recommend them anyway, but with my experience of the bafflingly large number of terrible hosting companies, this lot really stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>So here's the problem. HTML Dog is now regularly going over its bandwidth limit. WAY over it. Pretty impressive for a mere collection of such lightweight pages. And now, justifiably, Titan want some more cash. The thing is, they're not the cheapest hosting company in the world (not that they're the most expensive by any means) and HTML Dog obviously doesn't make any money.</p>

<p>Should a non-profit organisation delve deep into their (pretty empty) pockets for guaranteed quality of service and avoidance of hassle, or should they opt for an alternative (I've heard good things about <a href="http://www.newnet.co.uk/">Newnet</a>) that offers much more bandwidth at a more affordable price?</p>

<p>I just signed up with 1and1.com and for $10 a month you get 1G sotarge and 5Gig in bandwith... I think a great deal is there!</p>

<p>Another option os to get a hosting sponsor... if you get that much traffic you can use that as a pitch to one of the hosting companies like mediatemple.com or 2advanced.net and offer to advertise them for free for a discount.</p>

<p>What's your bandwidth cap?  Comment #2's mention of 5 Gig is pretty small.  For $27/mo, we get 5 Gig of storage and 50 Gig of bandwidth at Midphase, but their customer service isn't the best, nor are their features, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Yeah. It's those pesky web surfers. Thousands of the blighters.</p>

<p>There's nothing heavier on this site than a lightweight web page.</p>

<p>I do not know exactly what you need, but I have used <a href="http://www.pair.com/">http://www.pair.com</a> for years with no problems, good prices, and great service.</p>

<p>i.e.<br>
For $29.00/month<br>
- 700MB/day transfer (21GB/month)<br>
- 700MB disk space<br>

<p>Oh wait I have a solution:<br>
Go through all your pages and switch all STRONG and EM tags to B and I tags. Think of how much space that will free up. </p>

<p>The trouble with that is those elements are supposed to be *emphasised*. Just because they are styled in bold and italics doesn't mean it's the same. &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; are not the same as &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;.</p>

<p>That aside, knocking a few bytes off pages in this way won't help - the reduced size would be so miniscule it would just be a drop in the ocean.</p>

<p>I don't exactly how much bandwidth you need, but a couple thoughts:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eperfect.net/">http://www.eperfect.net/</a> is what I use. The largest package is 500MB of space, 20GB of bandwidth, 14.95/month. They're very reliable (I think my site's been down a whole twice in the year I've been using them, both for only part of a day, and I know two other website maintainers who praise their services). I don't know how the tech support is, honestly, mainly because I've never had to talk to them. ;)</p>

<p>You also could try <a href="http://www.fuitadnet.com/">http://www.fuitadnet.com/</a> Their *smallest* package is 4.99/month with 3GB space and 25GB of bandwidth, and it goes from there. I honestly haven't used them myself, but there's a very high-traffic website that I visit daily that is hosted by them, and it's almost never down.</p>

<p>Good luck with your hosting... I find this to be a wonderful resource. I got the chance to recommend it to a newbie website creator, and he thought it was great!</p>

<p>A quick glance at the source shows an excess of white space. Edit the PHP to take out the excess linebreaks (and tabs if you want). The filesize difference will be impressive. <br>
Also look into whether your host can support gzip/deflate on requested pages. Your pages will be miniscule after a spot of compression (and I hear it's easy to implement in PHP). All modern browsers can handle gzipped pages.</p>

<p>Follow-up: It _is_ really easy in PHP. See <a href="http://www.desilva.biz/php/zlib.html">http://www.desilva.biz/php/zlib.html</a></p>

<p>I would check out 1and1.com.  Post #2 said that it is 5 GB/mo, but it's actually 15 GB/mo. for 9.99.  I've used them for a while and have never seen them down (close to 7 months).  They have several other options, so check 'em out.</p>
