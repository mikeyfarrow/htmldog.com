<h1>CSS Specificity</h1>
	
<h2>Monday 16 May, 2005 (10:14AM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>I have added <a href="../../guides/cssadvanced/specificity/index.html">a short article about specificity</a> to the HTML Dog guides.</p>

<p>Back in the days when I was first getting to grips with CSS, now and then I would come across the strange situation of a browser ignoring my explicit rules. "I want that text to be yellow, so why are you insisting on making it white? Look! I've told you I want it in yellow! Damn you! I hate technology!"</p>

<p>What was happening was that my selectors weren't specific enough ï¿½ there was a conflicting, more specific rule in the stylesheet that was taking precedence.</p>

<p>It's not an obvious system, and often doesn't come in to play, but understanding specificity can prevent a lot of head scratching and give you a bit more control over what you want to do.</p>

<p>I struggle with this sometimes, certainly when I was just starting out with CSS. I've found that Mozilla Firefox's DOM inspector is a great help, as it will show you how each CSS rule is being evaluated and which rules are overwriting others.</p>

<p>Man, have I found myself saying that so many times!  Its like you're reading my mind.</p>

<p>Thanks for the useful information on the 'selector' math.  Never knew that.  Its already helped me out some...</p>

<p>That is a great overview there which I'm sure will help me with future CSS coding. Thanks</p>

<p>I'd like to point out something the article doesn't make quite clear: the values are in an infinite-base counting system.  Thus a single class selector has more specificity than a selector containing 25 element selectors.  This is why I started comma-separating the specificity values back in 2001, and the CSS2.1 specification uses a similar approach.  It makes it a lot more clear that specificity is not base-ten additive.</p>

<p>So I'd write your examples like this:</p>

<p>p has a specificity of 1 (1 HTML selector)<br>
div p has a specificity of 2 (2 HTML selectors; 1+1)<br>
.tree has a specificity of 1,0 (1 class selector)<br>
div p.tree has a specificity of 1,2 (2 HTML selectors and a class selector)<br>
#baobab has a specificity of 1,0,0 (1 id selector)<br>
body #content .alternative p has a specificity of 1,1,2 (HTML selector, id selector, class selector, HTML selector)</p>

<p>As for the question about browsers being consistent, the answer is "yes, with incredibly rare edge-case exceptions".  These tend to center on interactions between inline styles (which are represented as 1,0,0,0) and !important declarations, and are an article in themselves just because they're so obscure there's a lot of setup needed just to be able to explain the inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Thanks Eric. Good point, and an oversight on my part. There I was trying to simplify things when there was a glaring mistake in my logic :)</p>

<p>May be worth mentioning the Web Developer Toolbar for Firefox - amongst its many useful functions is one where you can click on an element on the screen and it shows you which CSS rules are being applied to it. Very useful for solving those "why's it doing that?" mysteries.</p>

<p>How important is !important?</p>

<p>Say, if I write something like this:<br>
p {<br>
  color: blue !important;<br>
}</p>

<p>div p {<br>
  color: red;<br>
}</p>

<p>... how would that be interpreted?</p>

<p>I've never used CSS until a friend of mine has shown me all the peculiarities. Though I'm sure there are even more comfortable style-managing stuff coming soon... </p>

<p>Thanks for attention. </p>
