<h1>The Definition of HTML</h1>
	
<h2>Friday 13 February, 2004 (10:29AM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, but it can imply much more.</p>

<p>I'm raising this point following arguments over the term, how I use it and what it can mean, and more specific questions along the lines of "why is HTML Dog called <em>HTML</em> Dog when it's about <em>X</em>HTML <em>and</em> CSS?". So here's my interpretation of 'HTML' and the reasons behind the 'HTML' in HTML Dog.</p>

<p>Firstly, the slightly smaller point about XHTML. Let's get this straight - XHTML <em>is</em> HTML. I'm not saying anything as specific as XHTML is HTML 4 or whatever, simply that XHTML, by its very definition, if a form of HTML - it's eXtensible HTML. XHTML is HTML just as a green banana is still a banana.</p>

<p>HTML is a much more recognisable abbreviation than XHTML and it has become a part of everyday language. That 'HTML' is more recognisable (particularly to beginners) was reason enough to call the website HTML Dog instead of XHTML Dog.</p>

<p>My next point is perhaps a bigger and more controversial one. It is that the term 'HTML' can also imply 'HTML <em>and</em> CSS'.</p>

<p>Whether right or wrong, modern HTML is intrinsically linked with CSS and when people who know what they are talking about talk of 'HTML' they often mean 'HTML and CSS'. For example, the 'official' job titles I have gone by over the years have been 'HTML Developer' or something similar. The jobs I find nowadays are for similarly titled roles. But these jobs always require knowledge and application of CSS.</p>

<p>HTML has become a shorthand term that may be historically and <em>logically</em> incorrect (when it comes to describing CSS) but can <em>validly</em> describe and be understood as XHTML <em>and</em> CSS. </p>

<p>Umm no.<br>
CSS is its own language. It just has to run inside a HTML document or linked to one. Just like Javascript. It's nothing at all without HTML, but that doesn't mean it's part of the HTML language.<br>
DC's definition: XHTML is an unnecessarily compliocated, unnecessarily stricter version of HTML that only people who have no backbone to the w3c use. <br>
That's not another attack against you, it's just the official definition that SMHC decided on.<br>
Nuff said.</p>

<p>Dante, the point I am making is not that CSS is part of the HTML *language*, but rather the *term* 'HTML' can imply both HTML *and* CSS languages.</p>

<p>A lot of it comes down to 'HTML' being less of a mouthful than 'HTML and CSS'.</p>

<p>Looks good Patrick.</p>

<p>Just so you know, I've recommended your site to anyone who asks me about HTML, XHTML and CSS. It's a great starting point for beginners and an excellent refresh for novices alike.</p>

<p>I also remind them that getting your feet wet is the best thing. It helps to start somewhere and no matter what anyone says, no one is an expert. We are all constantly learning.</p>

<p>html and css go hand in hand. we just use css as a way to format our text n the web page. its a good practice to use css. it makes the whole web page to be consistent and a particluar standard can be followed throught out the development of the web site</p>
