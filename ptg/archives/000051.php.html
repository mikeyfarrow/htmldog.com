<h1>Sons of Suckerfish</h1>
	
<h2>Friday 21 May, 2004 (10:59AM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Seven new articles have been added to HTML Dog.</p>

<p>Not only is there a <a href="../../articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/index.html">brand spanking new version of Suckerfish Dropdowns</a> with improved <em>Suckerfish :hover</em> JavaScript, there are a few siblings that have popped out too.</p>

<p>The articles explain how the effects of the <code>:hover</code>, <code>:active</code>, <code>:focus</code> and even the CSS3 <code>:target</code> dynamic pseudo-classes can be mimicked in Internet Explorer for Windows (versions 5.0 and up) with the tiniest piece of JavaScript, making them a real, viable practical option.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../articles/suckerfish/index.html">Sons of Suckerfish</a> - An introduction to The Suckerfish, how it works, how it can be implemented and why it is better than other methods.</li>
<li><a href="../../articles/suckerfish/hover/index.html">Suckerfish :hover</a> - The original lightweight, standards-compliant, accessible, cross-browser <code>:hover</code> mimic.</li>
<li><a href="../../articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/index.html">Son of Suckerfish Dropdowns</a> - Now multi-level, even lighter in weight, more accessible and more compatible (now works in Opera and Safari 1.2) than the original version, this has to be <strong>the</strong> best way of implementing dropdown menus and is probably the best example of The Suckerfish in action.</li>
<li><a href="../../articles/suckerfish/focus/index.html">Suckerfish :focus</a> - Mimicking the <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class, you can apply CSS rules to page elements that have focus, such as a text box that the user is typing into.</li>
<li><a href="../../articles/suckerfish/active/index.html">Suckerfish :active</a> - Ever wanted to style something a user is clicking on? Well, if you have or you haven't, here's a way to do it.</li>
<li><a href="../../articles/suckerfish/target/index.html">Suckerfish :target</a> - The CSS3 <code>:target</code> pseudo class allows you to style a targeted page anchor. Now not only will it work in Mozilla, you can now achieve the same results in IE too.</li>
<li><a href="../../articles/suckerfish/shoal/index.html">The Suckerfish Shoal</a> - If you want to use more than one of these pseudo-class mimics, here's a way to do it. The code's modular so you can cut out the pieces you don't need, leaving a slimline slice of JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<p>This collection just kind of 'sprang up' when <a href="http://www.danwebb.net/">Dan</a> and myself were putting together the improved <a href="../../articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/index.html">Suckerfish Dropdowns</a> ("Hey... what if we do <em>this</em>? Oo, and we could do <em>this</em> as well."). I think we might have got a little carried away, but I think it's been worth it.</p>

<div id="comment1" class="comment">
<h3><a href="000051.php.html#comment1"><span>Comment </span>1</a></h3>
<p>The comments on the Dog Blog now employ the Suckerfish :target method - if you select any of the comment numbers or simply go to <a href="000051.php.html#comment1">http://www.htmldog.com/ptg/archives/000051.php#comment1</a> , you'll see it in action.</p>

<p>This won't work unless your browser supports the :target pseudo-class (such as Safari 1.2 or Mozilla) or utilises the Suckerfish mimic (namely IE). So Opera, for example, won't get the benefits (I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the CSS3 pseudo-class is implemented in a later version though). Users of such browsers shouldn't lose out that much - as long as it isn't depended on for something critical.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble implementing the suckerfish dropdowns when used over a positioned div.  In other words, if the dropdown menu drops down over a positioned div you can not access the dropdown list with your mouse.  Instead the dropdown just disappears.  I just found this site.  I have been using the tutorial from alistapart.  I have not tried it with any new versions.  Is this issue solved in the new version?  Any suggestions would help enormously.  Thanks</p>

<p>Of course you could make it work in opera by changing the code a bit but it's operation is non-essential and if we changed the way it worked just for that one it would ruin the focus of the article.  If you want it to work in Opera stop moaning and change the code.</p>

<p>Re: Javascript vs the HTC. The HTC can be hidden in IE conditional comments so the validator won't see it. I've checked using IE 5.00.2920.0000 (Win2k) and IE 5.00.2614.3500 (Win98). Both worked. Lastly, the HTC is general purpose and can be used for much more than just the menus.</p>

<p>Andrew, IE conditional comments are a bit of a hack, reliant on proprietary code and I have to say that I'm not a big fan, but OK. As for the generality, that's partly what these Suckerfish aricles are about  - explaining that they can be used for much more than dropdowns.</p>

<p>To get dropdown above the positioned div in IE change the z-index of the positioned div to a lower value (like -1).  Worked on the page I'm building.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to have the submenus appear above the menu rather than below.  I don't understand completely what is happening with the positioning that being used right now (newbie) so I haven't come up with a way to do it.  Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I realized that as well when I tried it in Mozilla again.  Instead of changing the z-index of the positioned div, I ended up changing the z-index of the unordered list (ie. #nav li ul) to 2 or something else that is higher.  This works in both browsers.  Sorry about the mixup.</p>

<p>I am no expert, in fact quite the opposite, but have had pop out menus working solidly with Opera and Mozilla for a few months now at <a href="http://www.mouldingname.info/home.html.">http://www.mouldingname.info/home.html.</a></p>

<p>I have no clue about Javascript and would like to know if the 12 line js can be applied to my site. In the 12 lines there is "this.className" three times. I suspect I replace this with something, but EXACTLY what? Also do I need something in the head to enable the javascript?</p>

<p>Sorry to be clueless about Javascript but I've had a look at a book and it just does my head in. I am not the programming type I guess!</p>

<p>In response to comments 9 and 10 about Opera; it seems to work if you duplicate the style rules, i.e. use<br>
h2.sftarget { color: red; }<br>
h2:target { color:red; }</p>

<p>NOT<br>
h2:target, h2.sftarget { color: red; }</p>

<p>One question: any easy,  cross-browser way of making the hiding of the menu timed?</p>

<p>setTimeout("this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp(' sfhover\\b'), '');",500);</p>

<p>won't work because the first argument only takes a string.. so the "this" object reference doesn't work.</p>

<p>I love the suckerfish concept!  You guys rock!  The only complaint that I get is that if the user accidentally mouses out of one of the lower levels, the whole list disappears and they have to start over.  I tried to implement a timer that would give users a second to get back on if their mouse wandered, but then the  elements don't get hidden properly.  Any plans to offer such functionality?  I worked on it for 2 days straight and finally gave up.</p>

<p>Observing great form and answering my own question, I've found that width of "#nav li ul" must be greater than "#nav li" for this all to work right in safari.  0.01 of an em is enough, though someone will probably now tell me that breaks things in a more mainstream browser.</p>

<p>I seem to be having problems with IE/Win. When I slice the JS out of the page and put it into an external JS file, I get serious problems.</p>

<p>If I use the original Suckerfish JS (from the ALA site), the drop-down menu doesn't even work, even though it worked fine with the JS embedded in the page. The spelling of the file is correct, and the path is correct.</p>

<p>If I use the JS featured on this site, I get a JavaScript error in IE: "document.getElementByID(...) is null or not an object". Once again, if it is inside the page itself, it works just fine; but put it into an external JS file, and it f**ks up.</p>

<p>I want to keep a clean separation of content from code. Could anyone pass on to me any ideas why identical code would work inline but not externally?</p>

<p>Rene,</p>

<p>I was having the exact problem you are encountering. For me I determined it was when I was calling a non-existent id. So to correct the problem I changed this chunk of code in the function suckerfish:</p>

<p>            window.attachEvent("onload", function() {<br>
			var sfEls = (parentId==null)?document.getElementsByTagName(tag):document.getElementById(parentId).getElementsByTagName(tag);<br>
			type(sfEls);<br>
             });</p>

<p>to this:<br>
               if (document.getElementById(parentId)) {<br>
			window.attachEvent("onload", function() {<br>
				var sfEls = (parentId==null)?document.getElementsByTagName(tag):document.getElementById(parentId).getElementsByTagName(tag);<br>
				type(sfEls);<br>
			});<br>
		}  </p>

<p>Just checking to see if that id was indeed present before trying anything.  Hope that helps. By they way the Suckerfish code is a great piece of work. Thanks it's been a tremedous help.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am having some problems though; hopefully someone with a little more experience may be able to shed some light on this matter.</p>

<p>I have been trying to set-up a website for a very fussy client who insists on frames but not frames, little to no JavaScript (but I am willing to bend this rule a little) and a multi tiered dropdown menu. So far I have managed to incorporate a bit of my own design with a bit knowledge from Bobby van der Sluis’s article on ALA for positioning the footer (and header), which seems to work in Mozilla Firefox 0.9, IE 5.0, 5.5 and 6, Opera 7, NN 7. (No idea how Mac’s handle it as of yet.)</p>

<p>The problem is quite simple but the answer has so far proven to be rather illusive. The suckerfish is positioned in the header and the header is set to position fixed, this all works well when the dropdown has only one level. However when I add a second or third tier it breaks badly in any browser that can actually understand the fixed position property. I can allow all browsers to use the same code snippet as IE for positioning the header and footer, but this disables the wheel mouse in Gecko browsers. (Very annoying.)</p>

<p>My question. Is it possible to put the suckerfish inside an element that is fixed, or would my time be better spent modifying a brick wall with my head?</p>

<p>If there is no sure answer I will try to put the offending page together for an evaluation, time permitting. If the answer is a definite “no” then I assume I will need to find another way of doing it. (Though I don’t like my chances.)</p>

<p>Any help or ideas are more than welcome, I haven’t slept for a week. <br>
Thanks in advance.<br>

<p>--I am having one issue with IE. The dropdown doesn't drop straight down. It drops down and to the right.--</p>

<p>I had a similar problem with mine.  For me, it was a problem in the CSS for the div.  I had my text alignment set to center which IE goofed up on the drop downs.</p>

<p>Hi again.</p>

<p>After yet another sleepless night it would seem I have (hopefully) solved my earlier problem of using the Suckerfish inside a fixed element. It suddenly occurred to me that I had overlooked a simple context change that now that I have taken a little time to think about it seems perfectly logical.</p>

<p>The offending rule here was:</p>

<p>#nav li ul {<br>
	position: absolute;<br>
	}</p>

<p>The solution:</p>

<p>#nav li ul {<br>
	position: fixed;<br>
	}</p>

<p>This however will kill IE as usual so be sure to hide the fixed rule from IE allowing it to use absolute positioning.</p>

<p>Well I hope this is right and makes sense? I still need to test further but so far so good, with any luck this may help others who come across similar problems. Now I should be able to sleep again.<br>

<p>Having problems with cross-browser suckerfish spanning?  Sometimes you gotta bite the bullet and say to hell with 100% css design.  Just table that bad boy thusly:</p>

<p>&lt;div class="suckerfish"&gt;<br>
	&lt;table id="nav"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;<br>
		&lt;ul&gt;<br>
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Company&lt;/a&gt;</p>

					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Meet Pooter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>				&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
			&lt;/li&gt;<br>
		&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
		&lt;/td&gt;<br>
		&lt;td&gt;<br>
		&lt;ul&gt;<br>
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Products&lt;/a&gt;<br>

<p>					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Website Stuff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Custom Stuff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Consultation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>

		&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
		&lt;/td&gt;<br>

<p>You might want to get rid of the floats in your css.  But I don't think you need to.</p>

<p>I'm using the javascript from suckerfish drop downs to fix the hover pseudo classes in IE, on this page:</p>

<p><a href="http://testmh.clients.nixmc.com/crane/template_home.html">http://testmh.clients.nixmc.com/crane/template_home.html</a></p>

<p>Everything looks great in Firefox, Mozilla, Opera, but in IE, when I roll over the nav buttons, I get a 2pixel space appear below them which pushes them down the page/. I've been pulling my hair out all day on this one, have re-written the CSS several times in an effort to fix it, and no-matter what I do, the space still appears. It's something to do with using this line in my CSS (comments included).</p>

<p>#navitems li.first<br>
	{<br>
	/* Required to fix the double margin float bug in IE, but also seems to break the<br>
	hover effects by adding 2 pixels space underneath. WTF? */<br>
	display:inline;<br>
	}	</p>

<p>Would be greatful if someone could work out what is going on as it's stumped the pants off me. </p>

<p>A smaller and more efficient suckerfish shoal:</p>

<p>function suckerfish(func, tag, parentId) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (window.attachEvent) window.attachEvent("onload", function() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var elements = parentId == null ? document.getElementsByTagName(tag)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: document.getElementById(parentId).getElementsByTagName(tag);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (var i = 0; i &lt;lt; elements.length; ++i) func(elements[i]);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});<br>
}<br>
function makeClassToggler(startEvent, stopEvent, classToToggle) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var re = new RegExp(" " + classToToggle + "\\b"); re.compile(re.source);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var start = function() { this.className += " " + classToToggle;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var stop = function() { this.className = this.className.replace(re, "");}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return function(e) { e[startEvent] = start; e[stopEvent] = stop; }<br>
}<br>
var sfHover = makeClassToggler("onmouseover", "onmouseout", "sfhover");<br>
var sfFocus = makeClassToggler("onfocus", "onblur", "sffocus");<br>
var sfActive = makeClassToggler("onmousedown", "onmouseup", "sfactive");</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>~ The current code has two new closures being created for every element, this code only creates two closures for each type of suckerfish.<br>
~ The current code creates a new regexp object each time mouseout fires, this code creates one and precompiles it.<br>
~ The duplicated code in sfHover/sfActive/sfFocus has been collapsed down to one function.<br>
~ The target suckerfish is really an entirely different beast and should not be implemented with this technique.  A replacement for it follows in my next post.</p>

}</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>~ Unlike the other types of suckerfish, with the :target pseudo class we already know the ID of the element that we are interested in, so there's no reason to do any .getElementsByTag() and loop through them.  In fact, there's no reason to limit it to a particular tag at all.<br>
~ The current code mistakenly adds the sftarget class in the current when an shift+click/open in new window makes that the wrong target.<br>
~ Rather than hooking all the links, many or most of which will not be links to the current page, it is sufficient to wire-up body.onclick and let the clicks bubble there.<br>
~ Less code.</p>

<p>Awesome drop downs, I have used them a couple times already.</p>

<p>Two problems I can't get around thus far.<br>
1: In Both IE and Firefox for Windows I get little 1 pixel spaces between my menu items, where in firefox under Linux I do not.  And it's not every item, maybe very 2nd or third item.<br>
2: Is there a way to have each menu using a different width.  Maybe adhere to the longest text in the  tag.  I have one menu with a long string of text and to keep it all on one line, now all my menus are that long length.  </p>

<p>You can see examples of both of my problems here: <a href="http://www.ruffdogs.com/">http://www.ruffdogs.com</a></p>

<p>one other problem in IE and Mozilla is that when you have a flash movie just below the buttons. It will order the drop down menu back behind it so you won't see the links on the menu.</p>

<p>an application for the :active pseudoclass</p>

<p>First, what is a click and when does it occur?<br>
A click occurs after the mousebutton has been pushed; ie after the button is released.<br>
:active occurs before the click, on mousebutton down.</p>

<p>Let's say you create an anchor element &amp;lta&amp;gt with a background image.  When you push down the website visitor gets an alternate image and when he releases the mousebutton again the click occurs and he gets taken to the page that the anchor linked to.<br>
Pretty neat buttons could be created this way.<br>
Imagine buttons that have three possible views : normal, when hovering, when clicking.</p>

<p>Maybe you should use my button idea as a mean to display the SuckerFish examples more clearly.</p>

<p>Hi all.</p>

<p>I'm also using this menu, but i'm encountering some problems on IE (offcourse)<br>
The submenu items are now placed next to the main items.<br>
But I want the sub items (the second UL + LI's) to be placed above the main items.</p>

<p>So I just give the absolute positioned UL (subitems) less pixels on the left, so that it overlays the first UL.<br>
No problem...works great. Except the main item that comes after the subitems is placed above the subitems.<br>
I used a z-index on UL for subitems.</p>

<p>This works in every browser except in IE. I can't seem to fix it. The mainitem which is nest in line after the subitems is placed aboved subitems.</p>

<p>Pleade help...</p>

	if (!el.contains(event.toElement))<br>
		// MouseLeave<br>
}</p>

<p>Why do you need this?  When a user moves the mouse over each item, onmouseover and onmouseout events fire numerous times on the containing elements. When styles change in response to these events the elements "appearance" changes unnecessarily. Many, Many times.  This becomes more noticeable the larger the menu becomes in the form of a lag in response.</p>

<p>Suckerfish works perfectly for me. The one problem I see is a layout problem. Since the top level lists float that means if the browser resizes the lists start to stack under each other. Here's where it gets sorta hard. I decided on to keep this from happening. I split each set of top/sub links up and placed them into their own table cell. That fixed the the top links from stacking.</p>

<p>It worked perfectly in Firefox. I had mulitple  however IE does't understand it when multiple elements have the same ID. So is there a way of creating this with classes?</p>

<p>Excellent drop-down solution. I'm no javascript expert, so I have a question. Is there an easy way to get these drop-downs to work with OnClick instead of onMouseover and onMouseout? I have put a search form (enter keyword and press Go) in one of the lists. As I mouseover the Search menu option, the search form displays. Then, when I switch from my mouse to my keyboard to enter a keyword, my mouse sometimes slips off the menu option and  I lose the content of the list and therefore the ability to enter the search criteria in the form. Or maybe I am trying to get more out of this code than it is meant to provide? Thanks.</p>

<p>The dropdowns are great and a lifesaver BUT...</p>

<p>It appears that in IE 6.0 they aren't activated until the whole page has loaded; which if the page has pictures, may take some time. Until then the menus are visible but the dropdowns don't work. See <a href="http://www.cardbox.com/index.htm">http://www.cardbox.com/index.htm</a> for an example.</p>

<p>This is evidently because of the functionality that's tied onto onLoad in IE. (Mozilla Firefox works fine).</p>

<p>Just wanted to drop a message saying I love this technique. I use it on my site and it was very easy to implement. The reason I love it is because the dropdown is always going to be Relative to it's parent on the X Axis. Usually we use YPDropDownMenus and we have to reposition the menus horizontally. This always gives us problems when IE has a scrollbar and other browsers do not so our dropdowns are like 20 pixels off for other browsers. Thanks for posting this article.</p>

<p>Love the suckerfish shoal.    I seem to have one problem and it is probably a quick fix.  </p>

<p>I want to use sfHover on buttons, but not on text boxes.   Since both buttons and textboxes both are INPUT tags... they both do the same action when setting:  "suckerfish (sfHover, "INPUT" );</p>

<p>Putting parent id's is not really an option either because the forms are fairly extensive (texboxes and buttons)  and it would look like  soup very quickly.  </p>

<p>I tried using classes on the buttons and using: suckerfish (sfHover, "INPUT", "class" ); but that also didn't work.  (assuming because it is not a parent element) </p>

<p>So my question is:<br>
Is there any way to isolate texbox and/or submit buttons using the suckerfish shoal?  </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'm having a problem similar to Dave (post 98 &amp; 99).. just in a table. I'm using it to light up a cell when you hover over it (change background color).<br>
But it's only some cells I want to light up. I've isolated the cells with classes (class="normal", class="selected" etc.) and the other CSS stuff like borders and background are working fine on the different classes.<br>
But how do I isolate them in the "suckerfish"? I've tried many ways.. but can't seem to figure it out.</p>

<p>I'm making a menubar for a website I'm working on. I've basically taken most of the code from this page and implemented it into my own site. </p>

<p>I took the code and made two menubars actually. One at the top of the page, and one down from it after a table of dynamic content. Without getting too much into it, it basically works in Firefox, but not fully in IE 6, on Windows XP. </p>

<p>One of the menubar renders fully (the bottom) while the top one doesn't highlight at all in IE. Everything renders just fine in Firefox as you could imagine. </p>

<p>I made a separate style sheet for each menu, and a different javascript for each menubar as well. I still can't get IE to highlight the top menubar though. </p>

<p>Any ideas or suggestions?</p>

<p>Couldn't it be a good idea to hide the menu with Javascript at first? In that case, browsers that do not support it will show the menu so the site is browseable. With the current version for example, IE with JS disabled won't show the menu, because CSS has hidden it, but cannot bring it back.</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
I'm trying to solve the old problem of IE's select boxes showing through the otherwise perfect suckerfish dropdown menus (because of their z-index misbehaviour)... I've been using a similar approach to:<br>
<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/igstudio/design/ulsmenus/vertical-uls-iframe.html">http://homepage.mac.com/igstudio/design/ulsmenus/vertical-uls-iframe.html</a><br>

<p>This works well, but our menus are pretty massive and loading all those iframes at page load takes ages and is unnecessary. So I'm trying to adapt it to load the iframes on demand and have altered the javascript slightly. I'm slightly baffled as to why the code below doesn't work... does anyone have any ideas? (The second level menu appears but for some reason mouseover events don't fire correctly to load menus below that). Any thoughts appreciated.</p>

<p>Martin,</p>

<p>Check out the z-index. In your javascript make sure that you set the element's z-index higher than the iframe's. I had some trouble with this and finally did the following:</p>

<p>ieMat.style.zIndex="-1"; // iframe.<br>
ieULs[j].style.zIndex="101"; // ul</p>

<p>I had the same problem you're having in that the second level menu would appear but the mouseover events wouldn't  fire. This fixed it.</p>

<p>You can see the new version at <a href="http://tanny.ica.com/ica/tko/tkoblog.nsf/dx/select-tag-overlap-in-ie-part-ii">http://tanny.ica.com/ica/tko/tkoblog.nsf/dx/select-tag-overlap-in-ie-part-ii</a></p>

<p>BTW, if you have such a large menu structure you might rethink and separate the structure into smaller chunks.</p>

<p>Has anyone looked at the performance hit for this little hack in IE?  I was using it just to highlight rows in a data table (no dropdowns or other effects).  Just want to highlight a row when I mouseover.  It works fine in IE6, but CPU usage goes WAY up (on IE6 only)  when I mouseover (table contains approx 300 rows).  Response is also pretty sluggish, compared to Firefox.  No noticeable performance hit on Firefox.  (Both tested on Windows only so far.  1.4Ghz, 512Mb RAM).</p>

<p>I love the :focus script and would like to use it, but it's causing me some problems.  I have a search box that already has some onfocus code.  The field has a default value of "Search..." and on focus that is removed.  On blur, if the field is empty, it is set back to "Search...".  Looks awesome in firefox with the :focus style added.  But in IE, suckerfish overwrites my existing onfocus and onblur code.  If I try to do .onfocus += yadda yadda, then neither of them work.  It just doesn't do anything.</p>
