<h1>Desperately Seeking Wi-Fi</h1>
	
<h2>Friday  1 April, 2005 ( 3:55PM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Let's say, hypothetically speaking, you wanted to provide temporary wi-fi for a conference in London. In this hypothetical scenario, imagine that the venue doesn't have wi-fi and also won't allow you to plug anything in to their internet connection. Now you really want to provide wi-fi, because, well, it'd be really cool, and you know it can be done, but as hard as you try (and you're trying so hard you're tearing your hair out) you can't find any services that will sort this out for you.</p>

<p>What advice would you give? Better still, do you know of anyone that could provide such a service?</p>

<p>Comments or <a href="../../contact/index.html">direct contacts</a> welcome.</p>

<p>Wow, that would be a hard one.</p>

<p>At first I would say it would be nearly impossbile if the venue doesn't let you use their existing internet connection. Maybe contact a local ISP or something and see if they can offer a complete setup.</p>

<p>If there are any apartments or other businesses near by that already have WiFi, you could see about setting up a bridge connection that would essentially extend their coverage to the conference venue.</p>

<p>Thanks Jeremy. The reason why (I think) I know it can be done is that I did actually find somewhere who thought they could sort it out and they said something along the lines of  "install a temporary internet connection for exclusive use...install ADSL temporarily on any existing phone line or if necessary BT can install a temporary line."</p>

<p>So these guys seemed like a good bet, but getting anything out of them has proved to be like getting a drop of blood out of Uluru.</p>

<p>The venue has agreed to host a conference all about the web, but refuses to allow you to use their internet connection??</p>

<p>Well, they don't really care what the conference is about, to be fair. The more I look into it the more I realise just *how* crap the *whole* of the UK is when it comes to wi-fi. Frustrating.</p>

<p>Analog line bonding + an 802.11 base station should get you a nice WiFi connection. Surely you can get POTS lines from the converter, right?</p>

<p>I think what Daniel means is that you use software to bond multiple analog dialup lines  (normal telephone lines) to give an appearance of a bigger pipe and then connect 802.11 base station to it, so you can share this connection with others.</p>

<p>It should work, but it might take a bit of an effort to do so. If you pay for calls by a minute, it might also produce quite large costs. </p>

Don't know whether they do temporary installations or not. Other than that, either get the good ol' chin-wag going, or have the conference as "bring-a-wifi-box"... "Sorry, sir. No wi-fi, you're not comin' in."</p>

<p>Who or what is Uluru?'</p>

<p>My thoughts exactly.  It's the 'new' (i.e. original) name for Ayers Rock in Australia<br>

<p>i dont know if this helps, but in the US you could purchase a Sprint wireless card and bridge the connection to other devices.....</p>
