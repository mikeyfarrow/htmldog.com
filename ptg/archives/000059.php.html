<p>I watched a TV programme the other day and a voiceover said "You are not permitted to talk about this programme without written permission from the programme makers."</p>

<p>On the inlay of one of my CD's it says "You must not tell anyone about the existence of this album without explicit permission from the record label."</p>

<p>And I was shopping in a supermarket not too long ago when I saw stickers on the watermelons that said "If you tell anyone about these watermelons without the permission of the watermelon farmer you will be prosecuted."</p>

<p>Really strange... Don't they want people to find their site? Has Google got permission to link to Sellotape's site? What keeps the Internet alive is it's ability to give you information, but what if the information can't be found? If Sellotape doesn't want people to link to them, it would be hard to find their site, and they would be diggin their own grave.</p>

<p>Now, I've seen websites that only wanted you to link to their main page, and would get bent out of shape if you linked straight to a particular article, for instance.  But if you don't specify an article, how are people going to find it?  You go to the main page, and spend forever searching.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don't think it's right to link just an image into your page as if it were your own -- you're using their bandwidth and they aren't getting any benefits from ads and such, plus at that point, even though you technically didn't copy their picture, having it embedded implies that you have a right to use it, which you probably don't.  If nothing else, it's misleading.</p>

<p>So, just because you can link to something, is it right to in every case?   I say linking directly to a page should be OK.  This is how the 'net was designed to work, to organize and locate information in a loose collaboration.  If businesses don't like it, they can have their own net that noone else will visit.<br>

<p>Okay - I reckon companies like that should have their brand name subverted. Sello**** for example (put in the letters of your choice). The actual brand name would never appear on your page, and if you wanted to reference who you were talking about, you'd simply post a link to Google bringing up the company name at the top of the SERPS. A brand name is a massive investment, and easily subverted. Just needs enough people to start using it.</p>

<p>OR simply link to their competitors using relevant keywords in the links - sticky backed plastic, or whatever.</p>

<p>A blog network could have a lot of fun with this.</p>

<p>I guess they don't want people finding their website. I mean, not only do they not want to be linked, but they have FRAMESETS (shudder), which serve FLASH content, and they have not meta tags. Hmmm. I wonder if they even show up on google...?</p>

<p>Legally URLs are the same as street address. They cannot be copyrighted, so hyperlinking to them is legal. The hypertext within the link is copyrighted by whoever wrote the hypertext. Also linking in such a way that someone else's site shows up in your frameset raises copyright issues by giving the impression that their content is really your content.</p>

Wow guys, thanks for making it so easy to fill out an online permission form. We're really grateful, 'cause it's so very difficult to add links to our pages. Because of that I'll really try hard to promote your stupidity on my website now. Sigh!</p>
