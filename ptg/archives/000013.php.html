<h1>Image Maps Anyone?</h1>
	
<h2>Wednesday 17 December, 2003 ( 4:40PM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The <code>map</code> and <code>area</code> tags are bizarre little creatures.</p>

<p>I used to think that image maps - images with various clickable links mapped to areas on it - were for people who didn't know how to make web sites properly, that is, with the mentality of shoving a big image on a page and then slapping links all over it.</p>

<p>I'm not as dismissive as that any more, not quite, but I can't say that I've come across that many good uses for image maps and I've certainly not implemented one in years (although there was one big commercial website I was working on recently that employed an image map containing several graphical text links in a remarkably insane fashion).</p>

<p>The tags certainly seem completely unnecessary, especially when there are <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/imagemap/">much better ways</a> to go about doing such things.</p>

<p>I think that image maps still have there uses.  In an example such as the one in the A List Apart article.  I think the CSS method is better because it's actually a normal navigation system that because of the design would lend itself to using an image map to do.  Implemented using CSS is a good solution in this case because the navigation can then be restyled to look totally different if need be.</p>

<p>On the other hand, image maps that are used as a visual aid to help a user find some infomation (eg. A clickable map of the world) is a totally different matter.  In this case the use of image maps is the most appropriate because its conveying a meaning and is a helpful visual aid to users.  </p>

<p>The advantage of using an image map in this case is that an area can be non-retangular so it can match the irregular shape of a country for example.  This is not possible using CSS.</p>

<p>I do think its important to distiguish between the correct and incorrect use of image maps but I think they do have they're place in HTML.</p>

<p>Okay, yes, thinking it through there are more valid uses for image maps than I first gave credit for. These valid uses, as I see it  are for very specific detailed images that require non-rectangular selectable areas (because rectangular areas can be better handled with CSS, as already mentioned), such as a map of the world, as Dan says.</p>

<p>The real strength of that technique is NOT how to build an image map without using &lt;map&gt; &amp; &lt;area&gt; tags - that's a pretty pointless exercise when you have all the same functionality built-in to (X)HTML. The point is that you can take a &lt;ul&gt; and style it as an image map, where appropriate, and something else where not. Expect to see a few clickable image maps in the CSS Garden sometime soon!</p>

<p>image maps are a wonderful technique to provide links on an image. by this we can best describe what we are trying to say.</p>
