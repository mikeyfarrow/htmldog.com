<h1>CSS Property Reference</h1>
	
<h2>Wednesday 29 September, 2004 (12:03PM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p><img src="../images/properties.gif" width="203" height="107" alt="CSS properties">A <a href="../../reference/cssproperties/index.html">CSS property reference</a> has been added to HTML Dog.</p>

<h3>'Bout Bloody Time!</h3>
<p>It was over nine months ago that the <a href="../../reference/htmltags/index.html">HTML tag reference</a> was added to the site. At the time, the CSS reference was intended to follow shortly after.</p>
<p>The thing is, putting together these references is about as much fun as reading an especially boring phone book and that's my excuse for taking so long - I just couldn't put myself through the maddening ordeal.</p>
<p>But HTML Dog, a "comprehensive" guide to web standard (X)HTML and CSS, was a little incomplete without the property reference, so I just gritted my teeth, got down and did it.</p>

<h3>Level Two, Revision One</h3>
<p>The properties belong to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS 2.1 standard</a> (properties for aural style sheets are excluded). All of the valid values are listed and examples are thrown in for good measure. There are links to related properties and to the Guide pages, when relevant, for a more detailed explanation of usage. When other properties pop up in the description, they are also cross-linked - a feature that some suggested would improve the HTML reference.</p>
<p>As with the tag reference, the reasons behind writing it were to make a reference that is more digestible than the meaty, often confusing W3C documentation and to provide a more accurate reference than other sources, which tend to be either non-standard or non-very good.</p>

<p>As always, if you've got any suggestions for improvement, please <a href="../../contact/index.html">contact me</a> or leave a message here.</p>

<p>Well I hope nobody is complaining that it took you a long time. I can't imagine how much work was involved in this. Plus, you're just one guy, and you're doing it for free. So anybody who complains should be strung up in town square. Thanks for this and all the other work you've shared.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago, I looked over your site trying to find the CSS reference, I was sure had to be hidden somewhere. (Sort of like the Suckerfish articles, which can be rather hard to find as they are only linked to in the blog - how about adding them to your menu?)</p>

<p>Great that you have it now. This means that your site now is THE reference for me, since most other references are either extremely hard to read (like w3c) or describes things the way the work in IE (including mentioning IE-only properties without saying they are IE-only).</p>

<p>Thanks for a great site, and keep up the good work.</p>

<p>Awesome!<br>
Clearly, a bookmark in the "References" folder.</p>

<p>Slightly tangential, but I wonder how did they figure out dropping "text-shadow" from the 2.1 and then put it back in version 3... I know, so far only Safari and Shiira support it, so there isn't *much* to cry about, but nevertheless, it's confusing... The property is legal in CSS 2, illegal in CSS 2.1 and then legal again in CSS 3.<br>
With no means to specify 2.1 in the advanced interface of the Jigsaw CSS validator...</p>

<p>Muchas gracias, HTMLDog ;)</p>

<p>Amen to that, brother.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon this haven of CSS-sanity last week, by way of suckerfish (which is a lifesaver!), and I really haven't left the page since then. Too much web-design goodness! Keep up the good work!</p>

<p>I just spent a long frustrating day trying to find a reference to a basic HTML guide that I could point people at and I kept coming up with:</p>

<p>a) stuff that was simply out of date<br>
b) stuff on XHTML that was "hey look at this sexy new stuff" rather than just "this is how (X)HTML is now"<br>
c) cluttered, unusable, complex, and just too damn prosaic stuff - not the best example for them to follow</p>

<p>I was just about to give up and resign myself to creating something from scratch when I found your wonderful site - thanks.</p>

<p>Oh, and thanks. And thanks again.</p>

<p>Kiss, kiss, grovel.</p>

<p>I wish you would have had the forethought to offer all this information on a single page. I prefer hard copy for my reference sources. So when I try to print out this collection of data I ahve to go and assemble all of it in a file for easy printing. Thanks for putting this altogether, but I wish is had been more user friendly.</p>
