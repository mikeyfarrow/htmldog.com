<h1>Dog Blog 100</h1>
	
<h2>Wednesday 18 May, 2005 ( 4:11PM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>So this'll be the 100th post on the Dog Blog then. Woo-hoo!</p>

<p>This little blog isn't half as prolific as some (I remember Scrivs celebrating his 100th post when <a href="http://9rules.com/whitespace/">Whitespace</a> was about 3 days old!), and in trying to keep my personal life out of it (sorry, I dropped <a href="http://www.martagnan.co.uk/Meanderings/359/hit-me-with-your-musical-baton">the musical baton</a>) and focussing on <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr> (well, at least web design) issues in keeping with <a href="../../index.html">the rest of the site</a>, I'm not sure if I'm doing myself any favours or not. Still, it's been fun, and hopefully as interesting to others as it has been to me (well, a fair amount of people read it, so I must be doing something right!).</p>

<p>After a quick flick through, here's a selection of some of my favourite posts from the past 18 months or so:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="000096.php.html">Suckerfish™</a>, has fast become my favourite, having quickly turned in to a mix of riotous humour and nipple-hating outrage (you won't find much about web design here!).</li>
<li><a href="000049.php.html">Tables, My Ass</a> was not intended to be particularly controversial, and it was knocked out in good humour. It got a lot of attention and the responses (some quite emotional) were extremely interesting. </li>
<li><a href="000050.php.html">Son of Suckerfish Dropdowns</a>, if only because there are 264 comments (at the time of writing), amuses me no end. Bloody bane of my existence those things. </li>
<li><a href="000017.php.html">Mystical Yellow Form Fields</a> is an entry of particularly surprising interest, due to the number of people who find the website after trying to find out why the hell their form fields are turning yellow for no apparent reason. </li>
<li><a href="000053.php.html">All CSS Sites Look the Same</a>. Dispelling the myth that somehow, by using a certain technology, you're bound to certain design styles. Some interesting comments. </li>
<li><a href="000072.php.html">Watch Your Language</a>. Don't say "hell" or you'll go there, and should you swear on your site? </li>
<li><a href="000009.php.html" title="Bad Tags blog post">Bad Tags</a> holds the comments to <a href="../../guides/htmlintermediate/badtags/index.html" title="Bad Tags article">the article of the same name</a>. Interesting and emotional comments.</li>
<li><a href="000036.php.html">Against my better judgement...</a> is it going to far when you start to make up CSS jokes? Probably. </li>
</ul>

<p>So. There you go. Happy anniversary me. Will the Dog Blog make it to another 100?</p>

<p>So what happened? Did you start with 4?</p>

<p>Oh, and why not just continue the baton? What's the big deal? Why such a kill-joy (or kill-meme)?</p>

<h3><a href="000104.php.html#comment4"><span>Comment </span>4</a></h3>
<p>To answer your first question, a few posts got deleted along the way due to mistakes. It's the archaic Movable Type URL naming, which isn't ideal, but I've never got around to making it better.</p>

<p>On the musical baton thing, the point is that the Dog Blog, although most certainly is *me* and my thoughts, is still supposed to be a web development resource, to fit in with the rest of the site. So I have tried to refrain from bringing too much non-related personal stuff.</p>

<p>Now there is the internet. And I really appreciate people like you who take their chance in such an excellent way to give an impression on certain topics. Thanks for having me here.</p>
