<h1>Avoiding Email-Link Spam</h1>
	
<h2>Tuesday 31 August, 2004 (12:40PM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The problem with putting email address links (<code>&lt;a href="mailto:someone@somewhere.com"&gt;someone@somewhere.com&lt;/a&gt;</code>) on web pages is that they'll be added to spam lists. In the same way that a search engine will trawl through pages to find links, "spambots" will slither their way through the net to collect email addresses for evildoing.</p>

<p>I have a few addresses I've used for years that get a LOT of spam, and that's due mainly to those addresses appearing on web pages. It's the reason that a lot of web sites (including HTML Dog) avoid using them. It's a shame. Sometimes you really want to include an email link on a web page. Sometimes a contact form isn't good enough on its own - you want to open up as many contact options as possible.</p>

<p>When using email links, there are two main ways of cutting down on potential spam. The first is to use <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0102a.html#iajk">special characters in place of normal characters</a>, but it's <a href="http://www.dreamweaverfever.com/experiments/spam/">not as effective</a> as the second method - using JavaScript.</p>

<p>The examples I found on the net aren't great. What we really want to do in this day and age is cut out event attributes and inline JavaScript code and take full advantage of the DOM - pulling the code out of the page altogether.</p>

<p>So on a recent project I used this code and threw it into a separate JavaScript file:</p>

<pre><code>function view_address() {</code>
	<code class="m1">address_to_replace=document.getElementById("e").firstChild;</code>
	<code class="m1">real_address=address_to_replace.nodeValue.replace("[at]", "@");</code>
	<code class="m1">address_to_replace.nodeValue=real_address; </code>
	<code class="m1">address_to_replace.parentNode.setAttribute("href", "mailto:"+real_address); </code>
<code>}</code>
<code>window.onload = function() { view_address(); }</code>
</pre>

<p>And then in every HTML page there is an <code>a</code> element that looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id="e"&gt;pooba[at]chunkysoup.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>On the unusual occasion that JavaScript is not enabled, the user will be confronted with an understandable (not perfect, but better than nothing) email address. When JavaScript <em>is</em> enabled, the HTML is replaced with code that effectively resembles <code>&lt;a id="e" href="mailto:pooba@chunkysoup.co.uk"&gt;pooba@chunkysoup.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;</code>. It's just a normal email link as far as a human visitor is concerned. Most spambots, on the other hand, won't recognise them and won't add them to their lists.</p>

<p>This single-email-link-per-page (in a "contact us" section) serves my purposes, but there are obviously lots of variations on this DOM theme. If anyone has ideas for more generic code, please comment away.</p>

<p>That Enkoder thing produces ludicrous amounts of javascript and has no fallback for users with JS off.  I wouldn't recommend using that.  Although it looks pretty secure, I think that's cutting off your nose to spite your face a bit. </p>

<p>A little tip though, when you create new vars use the var keyword otherwise they are global rather than local to the function and could mess around with other scripts you have running.  Unlikely in this case but worth doing as a matter of good practice.  So, for instance:</p>

<p>address_to_replace=document.getElementById("e").firstChild;</p>

<p>would become:</p>

<p>var address_to_replace=document.getElementById("e").firstChild;</p>

<p>hmm, how long before email spiders catch on to the old [at] trick? any half decent coder could write a script that that found email addresses in pages using this kind of technique. However I guess it's a balance between losing accessibility and getting your arse spammed back to the stone age.</p>

<p>Personally, I like to know where I can purchase cheap viagra.</p>

<p>But, even if I didn't I have to say I'm not a fan of these JS based techniques. You're more or less guaranteed to get a shed load of spam whether you hide your email address or not. 'Spambots' only accelerate the inevitable and they'll soon be able to bypass all these hacks anyway. It's arguable that you're harming the accessibilty of the page by using techniques like this. </p>

<p>I can't think of a better way though. Except of course using a form for all email contact which would be a bit long winded in some situations.</p>

<p>You can also use a php to hide your email address from spam bots.  You provide a link to a php page that looks like this &lt;a href = "emailHider.php?user=info&amp;domain=BicycleAustin.com"&gt; text&lt;/a&gt;. It contains the following code: </p>

<p>Nice though your suggestion is, Adam, I don't think it'd work in practice. As these spambots are spiders, they would follow the obfuscated link, thinking it to be a normal page, and receive the Location header to the real e-mail address. A well-designed spambot would then recognize that in the normal manner. Any attempts are ultimately futile, anyway. I've received spam to webmaster@(mydomain) before, without even using that address.</p>

<p>The only reliable way I have found to defeat spambots is to display email addresses as image files without mailto: links.  A well-compressed png address is only about 1K.</p>

<p>Yes, it stinks that users can't click-and-mail, but there's something to be said for weeding out the lazy on non-commercial sites.</p>

<p>The reason why you were receiving the email at your webmaster@(mydomain) address is that most spam bots send emails to that is a common address for most domains.  This makes it likely target for spam.</p>

<p>There are a lot of trade offs when fighting spam mainly dealing with the convenience to the user versus reducing the amount of spam you receive is a tough task.  I'm not a fan of using web forms for email.  Sure it prevents spam, but as a user, I prefer to use my own email client.  When I post email addresses, I use a javascript technique (similar to the one posted here).  This combined with a good filter keeps the spam in my inbox to a minimum.<br>

<p>This doesn't stop dictionary attacks, name attacks etc and replacing the @ with it's unicode (or other) equivalent is encoding, not encryption. Just because john@example.com (substitute your address) isn't found on the web doesn't mean it won't get spammed. Write the email in human form rather than the mailto: link, even: e.g my mailbox is john, my domain is example.com -- but that still won't stop the spam :D.<br>
The way to reduce spam is to implement effective filters at the server level, make it unprofitable for bulk emailers, enforce the laws and ship email clients with HTML turned off by default, or turn off object and iframe support in them for good if you really want red text (goes a good way to stop those Win32 boxes from becoming from becoming owned relays).</p>

<p>function view_address() {<br>
	if (document.getElementsByTagName) {<br>
		var a = document.getElementsByTagName("a")<br>
		var i<br>
		for (i = 0; i = 0) {<br>

				real_address = address_to_replace.nodeValue.replace("[at]", "@");<br>
				address_to_replace.nodeValue = real_address; <br>
				address_to_replace.parentNode.setAttribute("href", "mailto:" + real_address); <br>
			}<br>
		}<br>
	}<br>
}<br>
window.onload = function() { view_address(); }</p>
