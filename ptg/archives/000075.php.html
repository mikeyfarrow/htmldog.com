<h1>Alexa Is Nuts</h1>
	
<h2>Wednesday 10 November, 2004 (12:23PM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>How the hell does <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> work? How does it figure out which site is more popular than another site?</p>

<p>Day to day <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&range=6m&y=t&url=htmldog.com">it certainly doesn't correlate to the HTML Dog stats</a>. One day it's ranked 40,000, the next 400,000! Now, my reliable information tells me that there's not much difference between those two days, so I can only assume that suddenly 360,000 websites became incredibly popular all of a sudden. But they must only be flash-in-the-pan successes because the next day HTML Dog'll be back up to 60,000 or something.</p>

<p>Nuts I tell you.</p>

<p>The bigger problem actually lies elsewhere. Okay, okay, actually, I <em>do</em> know how Alexa works - the statistics are collected from those who download and use the Alexa toolbar (which doesn't explain the mentioned phenomenon - that's all just nuts). Being an Internet Explorer-only application, it instantly excludes traffic generated by Mac users and Firefox/Opera/etc. users, which, as one example, will adversely affect the results of (and therefore misrepresent) sites such as web design blogs who tend to have a disproportionate number of readers who don't use IE.</p>

<p>So until Alexa manages to collect data from all types of web users, these rankings, especially those in the lower echelons, are hardly accurate. Which is a shame. I love this statistics stuff.</p>

<p>Hey, count yourself lucky. If you look at the page for my main site:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&url=mcgonagall-online.org.uk">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=mcgonagall-online.org.uk</a></p>

<p>You get a screenshot of my hosting provider's home page. That's also where it sends you when you click on the [Go to site now] button. "Nuts" doesn't come close.</p>

<p>You think that's nuts - When I  looked up my domain (dmwebsites.com) it comes up with details for comeclickbuy.com!  I've tried to contact  Alexa and get this resolved, but 5 months of emails and non-returned phone messages I've given up.</p>

<p>Does Alexa have any real bearing on SEO or overt relevance in the scheme of site placement anymore?</p>

<p>Alexa ... is wack. My site dropped 3 million points. Since the last time I checked a couple of weeks ago. I put no stock in these ratings. </p>

<p>Yay thank god for Firefox... Alexa cant find me now. I was getting sick of the Alexa tool bar installing itself on IE, since I've had Firefox I haven't needed Spybot Search and Destroy...Or Addaware...</p>

<p>Don't you have some kind of stat tracker You can use? Our servers are all connected to DeepMetrix <a href="http://www.deepmetrix.com/">http://www.deepmetrix.com</a> and as far as I can tell it's reasonably accurate.<br>

<p>Chris, that's because your host has only set up "<a href="http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/">http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk"</a> to point to your web site. "<a href="http://mcgonagall-online.org.uk/">http://mcgonagall-online.org.uk"</a> (i.e. no host header / subdomain) points to your host.</p>

<p>The fact that Alexa doesn't take into consideration traffic from Firefox or Opera has to dramatically skew the results.  Websites such as this are technical related and most technical people stay away from IE when possible.  Thus, I'm sure the Alexa results definitely undercut most techie websites due to popularity of browsers other than IE among the crowds they attract.  </p>

<p>My theory on Alexa's insanity is that their sample size is so small that just one visitor on your site with the Alexa toolbar can cause your stats to spike.  I think that Alexa is only useful to get a very general idea of traffic trends over several months. </p>

<p>Yes, Alexa is weird.</p>

<p>I discovered that just by installing their bar and setting my website as homepage, I went from position 300 000 to position 80 000 . <br>
So 1 surfer that visits a page very often  is probably enough to raise the website a lot. I removed the bar because they allowed competition to post false accusations without any proof in the reviews list.  My website went again over 100 000 ... without loss in my traffic :D . </p>

<p>I hate Alexa. Their website thumbnails are damned annoying. Screw the ratings! I judge how "popular" I am by Webalyzer and other server/FTP stats. I clicked in because I'm looking for a way to make those god-awful thumbnails go away! FF plug-in, maybe?</p>

<p>I don't mind alexa so much.  Sure it is a bit in accurate, but it is one more way of tracking stats and users.  Use it for what it is and not all the things it could be.  </p>

<p>I agree, Alexa has been going a bit unstable. Going up and down. But now mine is plunging slowly. I was just wondering if I drive more traffic to my site will that help raise my Alexa? I use to be hitting high until maybe I reached my peak. I hope they can tweak the Alexa program to more of a quality basis and also scan more frequently.</p>

<p>My Alexa ranking is also a strange animal. One day my free Mp3 site was at 2284 and three days later it was all the way up to 43971 then today I checked twice and it was different both times. Go figure. So I think that it isn't that accurate to say the least!  And Why doesn't it work for Macs anyways?</p>
