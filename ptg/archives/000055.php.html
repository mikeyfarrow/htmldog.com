<h1>HTML and CSS for Mobiles</h1>
	
<h2>Monday 14 June, 2004 (11:51AM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Although it's chugging along rather slowly (certainly more slowly than people predicted a few years ago), with phones and PDA's becoming ever more advanced, the mobile internet is clearly going to play a big role in the future of the web.</p>

<p>A problem in designing web pages for these platforms is the multitude of mobile devices (both PDA's and phones) that will no doubt render pages in different ways. If web standards were fully supported then it would be possible to optimise pages for these mobile devices without changing the underlying HTML - just like <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/">providing alternative styles for print</a>.</p>

<p>It all comes down the <code>handheld</code> media type. If that was supported then we'd be laughing - one style sheet for screen, one style sheet for print and one style sheet for mobiles, with code something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="screen.css" /&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" href="print.css" /&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="handheld" href="mobile.css" /&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>But here's where the practical difficulties kick in. In everyday web design it's often difficult enough to get hold of a platform other than the one you're using, but when it comes to mobiles, where the hell do you start?. I understand that the <code>handheld</code> media type <em>is</em> supported by some devices and software, but I don't know to what extent. I also know that some also apply styles specifically targeted with the <code>screen</code> media type. Tut tut. Naughty.</p>

<p>Opera have a browser for the Series 60 platform, which looks great. In fact, you can see what a web page would look like on it by going to the "View" menu and selecting "Small Screen" on a regular Opera browser. It has good support for standards (including the <code>handheld</code> media type), as you might expect from Opera but unfortunately, I'm assuming that this isn't that popular a browser for mobiles, although it does come pre-installed on a <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,,48691,00.html">certain new Nokia phone</a>.</p>

<p>Some phones have their own built-in browser (such as the <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,,32982,00.html">Nokia 6220</a>), and I assume a lot of PDA's do too. The mobile version of IE is bound to be a major player, but there could well be hundreds of different mobile browsers out there. Another factor is international differences, especially with phones. Europe has quite a different market to America and parts of Asia are in a super hi-tech world of their own.</p>

<p>Can anyone can shed any light on mobiles and how they handle HTML and CSS? I've constructed <a href="http://htmldog.com/test/handheld.html">a test page</a> that should show how a browser deals with <code>screen</code> and <code>handheld</code> media types (this works really well with Opera), so if you've got a web-enabled phone or PDA, please take a look at the page (<a href="http://htmldog.com/test/handheld.html">http://htmldog.com/test/handheld.html</a>) and let me know how many "applied" and "not applied"'s show up.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I tried your testpage on a Nokia 6600 mobile phone and tested it both in the built-in browser and in Opera.<br>
The results were:<br>
- Built-in browser: "not applied" to all items<br>
- Opera:<br>
  - link media="handheld".. applied<br>
  - style media="handheld"... applied<br>
  - @import... NOT applied<br>
  - @media handheld... applied<br>
  - other items (screen media): NOT applied</p>

<p>Guess I don't have to explain why I prefer Opera over the built-in browser :)</p>

<p>Great practical test, here goes:</p>

<p>iPAQ 4150, with Windows Mobile 2003 &amp; standard Pocket Explorer:<br>
screen: all apply<br>
handheld: all apply</p>

<p>Nokia 6600, with SymbianOS 7.0s, Series 60/2 &amp; Opera 6.2:<br>
screen: none apply<br>
handheld: "@import url" does not apply, the rest applies</p>

<p>With a nice (x)html/css design one could 'catch' the user-agent string (server-side) of the most important mobile devices out there, and show a site without css... Just a thought :-). Most mobile users only care about the real content, and will love the slim pages you give them without css...</p>

<p>Maurice and GeeBee - thanks for that. Interesting results. It appears that the in-built Nokia 6600 browser doesn't support CSS at all.</p>

<p>I'm surprised about the @import thing with Opera. I'm not sure if that's down to the media type specificity (@import url("whatever.css") handheld rather than @import url("whatever.css") - standard IE hates this and falls down) or if it's the @import rule itself. I'll have to add another test to the test page.</p>

<p>Colin, thanks - that does help.<br>
It's quite encouraging that a phone like the P800 that's been around for a few years has that support. I'm assuming that its successor, the P900, will also have good support.</p>

<p>On another note, after a bit of digging, it seems that whereas the "handheld" media type is recognised on Pocket IE for Windows Pocket PC 2003, it isn't recognised on PPC 2002. I'm not sure if that's true or not and I'm not sure how relevant this is in practical terms.</p>

<p>The browser may be awful, but it still supports transparent PNGs while IE doesn't. It's pretty bad when Microsoft's web browser gets beaten by a handheld device.</p>

<p>Yeah, Opera really is better than Mozilla when it comes to standards and browsing features :)</p>

<p>The handheld-hell problem looks like an interesting research topic, but I'm already knee-deep in San Francisco History and Atomic Bomb research (not to mention being unplugged from all computers for almost 2 months beginning later today...). </p>

<p>Good luck in your research PTG....Maybe you should get one of those emulators...</p>

<p>I have a Palm Tungsten C Handheld and I have two browsers installed on it.<br>
Below are the results respectively:<br>
+++<br>
Web Browser v. 2.0.1.1 (Pre-installed)<br>
Screen : All 4 tests applied<br>
Handheld: @import url("whatever.css") applied - Other three not applied<br>
+++<br>
Palm Web Pro v. 3.0.1b<br>
I paid for this browser upgrade, by default it filters pages with a proxy server on palm's network.<br>
With the proxy server enabled, none of the tests are applied.<br>
With the proxy disabled there are two modes available:<br>
- "Normal View" Rendering:<br>
&gt; none of the tests are applied for either screen or handheld<br>
- "Handheld View" Rendering:<br>
&gt; This mode gives you the same results, none of the tests are applied in either screen or handheld.</p>

<p>Palm has another upgraded verson of their Web Browser Pro, but it is only available for Bluetooth devices, The Tungsten C has wifi, but not bluetooth, so it will not work on mine.</p>

<p>And as a test on AvantGo, none of the tests are applied either.</p>

<p>Hope this is helpful to you.</p>

<p>The Motorola T720i phone didn't apply any style rules.  However, I've never been able to figure out just how much HTML it supports in the first place (some pages won't even display at all), so chances are it  just doesn't handle CSS.</p>

<p>I use the Treo 600. It uses the Blazer 3.0 browser which by default renders pages in an "optimized" narrow display mode. You can select  a "wide" mode which gives you a window to the web page. To see the page the user scrolls from side to side. I prefer the optimized mode as it allows you to select an url by pressing the right arrow and go to the url by pressing the enter key or middle button of the arrow selector.

<p>I found that IE on my fathers Windows CE Dell Axim will render the screen stylesheets.  I did, however, find that if you wrap your screen stylesheet in a </p>

<p>@media screen {</p>

<p>/* stylesheet goes here */</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>that his version of IE will ignore it like it is supposed to.  </p>

<p>Lemme recap: it renders it if you use the  syntax, it renders it if you use the  import, but it does not render it if you put your external stylesheet in a @media screen {   } wrapper.</p>

<p>What I do then is use the  to feed the handheld the same stylesheet I feed to NN4 and IE4.</p>

<p>Thanks Rob. This is all so damned confusing (although interesting at the same time!).</p>

<p>I managed to get my hands on a Nokia 6600 yesterday and realised the same kind of thing - it didn't apply any of the cases in the test page, but it did pick up the general styles (like the borders and the red colouring of the "not"s). So the proprietary Nokia HTML browsers clearly just ignore everything apart from media="all". Well, at least they don't apply "screen"....</p>

<p>I'm using the new Motorola V600 on Cingular with its built in browser. All screen styles were NOT applied. All handheld styles WERE applied. Pretty good! </p>

<p>It also renders tables, although a 4-col table has columns only about 1/4" wide because it squeezes the whole table into the screen available (no horizontal scrolling on this phone). The only downside of my service is I can't download pages bigger than 10K, so I can only use nice lean mean sites that keep their code nice and trim using css. Not sure if the download limit  is the fault of Motorola or Cingular, probably Cingular.</p>

<p>I have also been investigating this subject and found that many cell phones, even color ones, ignore foreground and or background colors (to "protect" the user from dangerous colors I imagine), and may also ignore font sizes because they only have one or two sizes available, but may apply other styles. That means some of the ones that don't look like they are reading the handheld stylesheet may be reading it but choosing to ignore the things you are testing. </p>

<p>This may not be as bad as it sounds. One of the most important things about using the handheld stylesheet is being able to count on it to hide parts of the site that are not applicable (or even dangerous) to the small screen. I can live with a cell phone that doesn't show all my colors so long as it hides the big, unnecessary parts of the site (like many of the navigation links in the left column which I encase in a div with "display:none" for handhelds). I don't imagine you want to make another example :-) but it would be interesting to find out how many devices will support an important feature like "display:none".</p>

<p>Also, I have also discovered that some cell phone service providers may be interfering with or changing the style on their proxies before passing it down to the phone (again I am sure to "protect" all of us). This means that some features that don't show up on a phone with one provider might show up on another provider. </p>

<p>Related to a comment above about AdvantGo -- I just read on their site that the latest version of their software DOES support styles. Not sure how widely used the new version is (or if it is out yet).</p>

<p>Related to the comment about using emulators -- there are dozens of them each of which mimic different PDAs and phones, and they are not exactly the same as looking at the real thing anyway. They're probably good mostly to get a general idea what things will look like. The best test is one like this -- with real phones and PDAs.</p>

<p>I also read somewhere that Nokia only supports the handheld stylesheet if it is the first one in the list. I also read that support for @media(handheld) is less reliable than a linked stylesheet with the type media=handheld. I have no idea if either is true, but maybe someone else does.</p>

<p>I can't  believe noone's mentioned iSilo (<a href="http://www.isilo.com/)">http://www.isilo.com/)</a> yet!  Results are as expected: first, second and fourth in each set are applied, so obviously it's ignoring the media type in all cases but failing on the "@import url(...) TYPE" command.</p>

<p>I really ought to give it more of a thorough going over with some CSS to see how compliant it is.  Impression I get from my own work is that it's not up to the really complex stuff; it gets font sizes VERY mixed up at times.</p>

<p>I tested it on my Sony Ericsson P800, and obtained the same results as Colin (Comment 6), however, I did some further testing with other media types, and found some interesting results...</p>

<p>So I decided that instead of just focussing on handheld and screen media types, why not test them all.  I made up some complete test cases to test every single combination of media type, MIME type and !DOCTYPE, as well as starting to publish some user agent support charts.  The number of tests may be just a bit of overkill, but I figured why not, it wasn't much effort to add the extra just to be 100% complete.  I also added the &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; processing instruction which you omitted from your test.</p>

<p>The P800 correctly applied all styles from all and handheld media types, except when served as text/html  It turns out that the P800 will process the ?xml-stylesheet? PI no matter which mime type was used (text/html, application/xhtml+xml or text/xml), however it should not process it for text/html.  It also applies all styles from a &lt;style type="text/css" media="xxx"&gt; for all media types except embossed, and I thought that was very strange.</p>

<p>Here's the tests: <a href="http://www.lachy.id.au/css/tests/media/">http://www.lachy.id.au/css/tests/media/</a></p>

<p>I would appreciate it if others would submit their results to me using any device or media type you have available, including the handhelds tested here.  I've provided a template to make up a support chart quite easily, that I can publish on my site.  Of course, comments on ways to improve the support charts, tests or anything else would also be appreciated too.</p>

<p>PocketPC 2002 handhelds have IE 3.02 which does not support CSS at all, nor does support DOM1. I think it does not support Javascript too, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>PocketPC 2003 reports its version as IE 4.01 and thus again no DOM1. </p>

<p>I just got my new Treo 650, and I'm happy to report that the new palmOne Web Browser (Blazer 4.0) now reports that all the styles were applied.  As others have noted, the version that came with the Treo 600 did NOT apply the handheld styles, so this is a definite improvement.</p>

<p>Patrick, really great test you have there and I think you have found a gold nugget there, despite the poor support by a number of people. You need to build another article around it and see if you can use it to build a universal mobile device system (like I have) that seems to deliver a good xhtml mobile style layout that works on the majority of agents, despite the crazy support we are all experiencing. I will tell you how....</p>

<p>I hate browser sniffing and all forms of scripted tricks to figure out which versions of a web page and style sheets a given mobile device supports. Yet, we obviously have all these people with various states of agents and style support, even if it is pretty bad. However, your style tests proved, as occured on my mobile phone, that as long as you include, in your web page, BOTH handheld style sheet "link types" (link with media="handheld" and @import url (...) handheld;) with urls to a very robust mobile style sheet that includes cascading rules covering every aspect of your screen-based sheets, you can design a pretty powerful mobile sheet strategy that works for all the people listed above, except ONE TYPE....and thats those that only support screen media and NO handheld version of your test (ie. some pocket PC people). THats a troublesome group as they cant get to your handheld sheets which reformat your content for all the other agents. As is the case with that group, those devices seem to be designed around support of the full desktop browser version anyway! I proved this scenario after I discovered your test this summer, and though my phone supported all the screen versions BUT also one handheld version, it was all I needed to create a decent mobile solution using XHTML and CSS in which that handheld sheet was used to cascade over my screen sheets, and deliver a great version to my tiny phone browser, while retaining the fully layout for desktop users. In other words, by first designing your main web site in compliant XHTML and CSS, then adding in the two handheld url links to the same mobile sheet, and then designing that mobile sheet carefully so that it hides and reveals (cascades over) all the things needed for most mobile screens and devices, you stand a decent change of designing something that works well on a number of agents. Those agents that support ANY version of the handheld media test can get something redesigned, as can those that support no style sheets of any type.</p>

<p>Because MANY devices seem to support one of the handheld sheet rules, and MOST are supporting or moving to support XHTML (basic) despite the movements worldwide, doing the above, a talented CSS developer could build a pretty good universal mobile test site and sheet system, that works pretty good in a number of devices, not to mention still delivers the screen sheets that look great on desktop browsers. Even if the device has NO style support at all, they still get fairly good linear content listing using clean xhtml markup without any sheets. Thats been my experience. So I say, your 8 point test proves there is a hope! Again, for those of you not supporting any handheld sheet, if the designer has designed their markup and menus correctly using the new xhtml standards, such as unordered link lists, and content is contained simple divs in xhtml rather than tables, and added mobile headers are used with display:none applied, when the non-styling agent reads that, its pretty accessible content when it gets to this broad range of devices. Again, its the people that only support "screen" that may be a problem, but it seems most of those stand behind some of the larger pocket pc devices.<br>
-Mitchell<br>
---------------------------------<br>
BTW, my test is the exact OPPOSITE of the Sony Ericsson P800 with Opera user, in which of the 8 forms of style sheets it supports using your test, which shows how sad the standard is for mobile devices (I have a Sprint Sanyo SCP-7300 phone with NetFront micro-browser, and supports ALL screen sheets and only the import handheld flavor. As long as your device supports either no styles or at least one fo the handheld, you can design for your agent and many others.....it can be done!)</p>

"</p>

<p>Firstly I thought this is an article about HTML and CSS for mobile devices.</p>

<p>But if I looked at the source code of your test page I saw it is an XHTML page.</p>

<p>Therefore: Are you talking about HTML and CSS or are you talking about XHTML and CSS?</p>

<p>On Nokia 6610i it says none applied, but still I'm having a hard time hiding 'screen' stylesheets from the built-in browser on pages I create myself. Not sure what I do wrong, actually, but it seems to download and render stylesheets no matter what I do to hide them from it. I've tried to set media to "print" of course, tried to @import it with and without the 'screen' keyword, tried applying an 'id' attribute on the LINK element...</p>

<p>Nothing has worked so far. The built-in browser in Nokia 6610i still downloads my 'screen.css' file and tries (miserably) to render it. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong?</p>

All screen styles were not applied; all handheld styles were applied.  It draws borders around the DIV elements too.  I was actually a little surprised, since the browser seems a bit too simplistic for a lot of sites.</p>

<p>The device definitely does use (at least some) CSS, but it seems to be a non-standard implementation.  My research continues... thanks!</p>

<p>Although, test results were dissapointing, it seems wierdly that the browser renders CSS-pages with both the screen and the handheld styles. Go figure.</p>

<p>Sony PSP with built-in browser (firmware 2.6)</p>

<p>All screen applied.</p>

<p>link media="handheld" - NOT applied<br>
style media="handheld" - NOT applied<br>
import url("whatever.css") handheld - APPLIED<br>
media handheld - NOT applied</p>

<p>I think the only reason it applied the "import url() handheld" directive is because of a bug. This seems to be confirmed by using the PSP to visit this page, where all the @import directives work regardless of media type: <a href="http://lachy.id.au/dev/css/tests/media/xhtml10.xhtml">http://lachy.id.au/dev/css/tests/media/xhtml10.xhtml</a></p>

<p>Hmm. Is PSP really a handheld? What do you think? Obviously you hold it in your hand, so there's that... but it's got good bandwidth (802.11), a widescreen color display, animated GIF support, sound and video capability, etc. Given the official descriptions of the media types, I would say PSP almost seems more like "TV" than "handheld". What do you think?</p>

<p>handheld: Intended for handheld devices (typically small screen, monochrome, limited bandwidth).<br>
tv: Intended for television-type devices (low resolution, color, limited-scrollability screens, sound available).</p>

<p>In any case, it only seems to respond to screen right now. Which in practice is a little obnoxious because many pages have graphics that are just a touch too big for its screen and make it obnoxious to scroll around... they would benefit from a PSP-specific page.</p>

<p>123 / Is PSP really a handheld?<br>
My Uk spec 02 XDAIIi (windows ce based) also has WiFi (802.11g), a widescreen colour display (if set to landscape mode), plays animated gifs, sound and video support - NOT LIMITED TO SONY's PROPRIETARY FORMAT, and it's got a 1 gig memory card (SD) that cost next to nothing. Oh, and the device itself cost NOTHING (contract upgrade!).</p>

<p>Have just bought a PSP for my son (Christmas), but have avoided all accessorie etc for anything other than games playing (which it is SUPERB at). It simply fails to cut the mustard at anything else, and the memory stick/proprietary video format makes it a no-no for anything else. Doesn't stop it being the best hand held games machine in the universe though...</p>

<p>I've been investigating this very issue, so I'm glad you guys have been discussing it.</p>

<p>I tried you test on a Nokia 6822 and it returned no for every thing, which suggests that it doesn't recognise styles.  But as has already been mentioned they do read styles, so I'm at a loss as to why your test result on the 6822 came back negative.</p>

<p>I've be investigating this from a different angle.  I've been trying to get the 6822 to ignore the media =" screen" in the link tag and just pick up the media="handheld" but it keeps on reading both style sheets with disastrous results :o(</p>

<p>I decided to devise little a test of my own, to see what was going on.  I don't have the expertise to test for every possible out come, so I decided to test for,</p>

<p>1.  To see if the 6822 treated the media="screen" any different to media="handheld"<br>
2.  To see if there was any difference in how the it dealt with the id and class attribute along with contextual selectors.</p>

<p><a href="http://carjen.co.uk/mediatest/index.htm">http://carjen.co.uk/mediatest/index.htm</a></p>

<p>Now my code could be flaky, so run a few tests your self to be sure.</p>

<p>The result was that the 6822 read all the media="screen" styles with ease (so how the heck am I going to product a mobile style sheet then....grrr)</p>

<p>But when it came to reading the media="handheld" styles, every thing worked, except the contextual selector (where do you go from here?)</p>

<p>Like I said some of my code might be flaky (although I did validate it markup but the w3 css validator is down)</p>

<p>Not sure I want to look any further into this, as it sound like a lot of trouble!<br>
