<h1>&lt;pre&gt; Is Not Presentational!</h1>
	
<h2>Saturday 27 November, 2004 ( 4:41PM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>"You shouldn't really use the <a href="../../reference/htmltags/pre/index.html"><code>pre</code></a> tag because it's presentational. You should use the CSS statement <code>white-space: pre</code> instead."</p>

<p><strong>NO!</strong></p>

<p>You use <code>pre</code> when the <strong>spacing in between characters is just as important and meaningful as the characters themselves</strong>.</p>

<p>I just needed to get that out of my system...</p>

<p>&lt;pre&gt; is neighbours with &lt;blockquote&gt;, and cousins to &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;.  I mean, under the argument for not using &lt;pre&gt;, you shouldn't use &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;, but instead put a &lt;span&gt; on the text with the bold css'd.  </p>

<p>I prefer to use css to style the code tags as preformatted. I also agree with Gabriel K though, kinda (if I know what he means). You definately shouldn't be using spans in the place of em and strong, because both of those hold true semantic value, whereas a span holds none when used without styles and the such.</p>

<p>I would not use the pre tag, except for ie having appearent problems with white-space: pre;, or does it work? I tried a while back on a complex page, but I might try again sometime.</p>

<p>The dog has it right.  PRE is not presentational when the whitespace in the text is ingrained in the content.  It's the same logic as not using CSS image replacement for an image that's, say, part of an article.</p>

<p>Think about it this way: Markup should correctly display the content even when the CSS is stripped away.  If you use &lt;span style="white-space: pre;"&gt;, that won't translate into browsers which don't support CSS (or users who turn stylesheets off).  If the spacing is critical to the content, such users won't be able to read it.</p>

<p>When exactly would the white space be as important?</p>

<p>Because with code you should use the code tags, and anything else is just applying its style to the content.</p>

<p>An example would help your case, and in fact the very definition of the tags would suggest that it is for formatting, not meaning. I can't actually think of a use of it that isn't presentational.</p>

<p>this tag seems to be very helpful when need is of presenting simple tables in web pages<br>
i mean one can really try to do it using css but i don't see a decent way to do it simply yet<br>

<p>Oh, this is sticky. And I wouldn't be surprised to be named the source of the quote.</p>

<p>&lt;pre&gt; presupposes that the whitespace is vital to the content. Major point.</p>

<p>Generally, HTML Dog promotes a separation between presentation and content. That is, if it's red text, that's decoration, not content. So red color is to be suggested in the CSS.</p>

<p>Now, what about italics? Italics could be noting emphasis (&lt;em&gt;), or it could represent a variable (&lt;var&gt;). Or it could be just decorative.</p>

<p>But what if, in the standard style for the language in question, italics have MEANING? For example, the "Dies Irae" from Faure's &lt;i&gt;Requiem&lt;/i&gt;, or an attack on the &lt;i&gt;USS Cole&lt;/i&gt;? If we use CSS for these instances of italics, we make the no-CSS (and totally legitimate) rendering of the HTML lose the semantics the italics represent. By using the &lt;i&gt; element, we are imposing presentation within the content.</p>

<p>Sometimes, presentational traits are intrinsic to the content.</p>

<p>Back to &lt;pre&gt;. This element preserves whitespace. But isn't whitespace, by definition, presentational? Of course! So if you champion separation of presentation and content, you cannot approve of &lt;pre&gt;. You'd be OKing the inclusion of presentational information within the HTML.</p>

<p>Guess what? The division of presentation vs content is a lie.</p>

<p>The trick is to be able to discern between decorative space and integral space. If the content demands a specific spacing (a snippet of code as indented by the author, a poem formatted for artistic visual effect, etc.) then the content demands a particular presentation.</p>

<p>Basically, this means that so long as we can semantically back up the HTML  we use, it doesn't matter whether we use markup which includes specific presentational aspects. So long as we understand that some presentation is decorative, and some is connected to meaning, the way we treat such presentation must vary.</p>

<p>The real divide is not between presentation and content; it is squarely between decoration and meaning, and it's as simple as that.</p>

<p>Absolutely.  A key question for me is always  "does this page 'work' without the CSS"?  Does the content make sense viewed in a non-styled enviroment?   Far too many people forget this very important factor.  The world is not just a CSS compliant browser like Mozilla.  it's beyond that.</p>

<p>My general feeling is that &amp;ltpre&gt; and its cousins &amp;ltstrong&gt; and &amp;ltem&gt; are not presentational because they simply indicate distinction from surrounding content - albeit with default presentation (whitespace, italics, etc.).  Default presentation imposed by a browser should not make an element presentational by definition.  Browsers impose default attributes on &amp;ltp&gt; elements, for example (top/bottom margins), yet we would not claim that they are presentational in nature.<br>
The &amp;ltpre&gt; element, then, is not presentational.  Instead it indicates that the presention should be distinct from surrounding content and browsers have default ways of presenting that distinction.  CSS is used to modify the default presentation.</p>
