<h1>The Apple UK Anti-CSS Conspiracy</h1>
	
<h2>Monday 31 January, 2005 ( 5:06PM <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>So, I got me <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macmini/">one o'them Mac things</a> that people go on about so much.</p>

<p>I like it.</p>

<p>It's not long before I'm tinkering away, installing this and that - Firefox, Thunderbird, a couple of code editors... hold on a minute... <strong>Where's the bloody hash?</strong></p>

<p>No, my friends, I do not expect Apple, as liberal and "down with the kids" as they appear to be, to bundle <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hashish">herbal narcotics</a> with their machines, I mean the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hash%20character">"#" character</a>. Commonly known as the "pound sign" in the <abbr>USA</abbr>, here in the <abbr>UK</abbr> we've already got one of those - "£". And "£" is what sits on top of the "3" key on every <abbr>UK</abbr> keyboard. I understand that on <abbr>US</abbr> keyboards, "#" appears on the "3" key, but here, on any non-Apple keyboard, it gets its very own key. So where do Apple put "#" on their <abbr>UK</abbr> keyboards?</p>

<p>Scan keyboard once... can't see it. Scan it again... still can't see it. Carefully work my eyes over each key. It's not there! What am I supposed to do? <strong>Write <abbr>CSS</abbr> without <abbr>ID</abbr> selectors?!</strong> This is insane! Where's my hash?! Don't Apple want me to make lovely <abbr>CSS</abbr> with their sexy computers? You might as well just omit the "&lt;" character, or even a letter or two. Space bar? Who needs it?!</p>

<p>Now this obviously won't come as news to any Mac savvy chappy, but I had to rely on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/">a friendly detective</a> to reveal that the secret lay in "alt"+"3". Oh, joy of joys, I can write <abbr>CSS</abbr> after all.</p>

<p>I'm Ali Baba, "#" is the treasure behind the door and "alt"+"3" is "Open, Sesame!"</p>

<p>Or something.</p>

<p>Congratulations on getting a Mac Mini! I'd get one myself if I didn't already have two Macs.</p>

<p>About the keyboard thing... on my Swedish keyboard, "shift"+"3" is "#", while "alt" + "3" is "£". I guess they figured that UK residents are more likely to want to type "£" than "#". That's probably also the reason for "shift" + "4" producing "€" instead of "$" on EU keyboards.</p>

<p>As a general rule, if "shift" + something doesn't produce what you expect on an Apple keyboard, try "alt" instead. Or even "shift" + "alt".</p>

<p>If you want to know where a key is, there's a keyboard viewer. It's not very easy to access, but still it exists ;)</p>

<p>Go to System Preferences -&gt; International -&gt; Input Menu. Check "Keyboard Viewer" in the list. It automically checks "Show input menu in menu bar".<br>
You can now access the Keyboard Viewer from the input menu.<br>
Then, as Roger Johansson said, try shift, alt, shift+alt...</p>

<p>Glad I found this thread! I thought I had a dodgy UK keyboard - Alt+3 for # though? Shame on them! ;)</p>

<p>I've had my iMac for 3 days now, and still don't quite understand why the " and @ are switched around from the keyboards in the PCworld - I just assumed that all key layouts were standard, but clearly not! So much to learn - still it's fun!</p>

<p>Can anyone explain to me how Home and End are implemented on the Mac keyboard, for use in web form text fields? I know I can use CTRL+Right arrow (or is at ALT+Right Arrow - I forget, I'm on a Thinkpad right now), but I would have thought that there would be keys that did that by default? </p>

<p>Sorry, completey newbie questions.....</p>

<p>Hello everybody. I've made a UK.keylayout file which can easily be installed in OS X. This file will map the " @ # ~ \ | £ ` keys to be where you would expect them to be on a UK keyboard.</p>

<p>How to install<br>
1. Unzip archive<br>
2. Copy UK.keylayout to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/<br>
3. Log out and then back in again<br>
4. Go to System Preferences -&gt; International -&gt; Input Menu<br>
5. Scroll down half-way to UK, tick check box<br>
6. Scroll back to top, un-check previous setting<br>
Done.</p>

<p>Download at: <a href="http://www.msephton.plus.com/UK.keylayout/">http://www.msephton.plus.com/UK.keylayout/</a></p>

<p>Let me know what you think of it.</p>

<p>Actually, there is a MUCH easier way to show the hash characters.</p>

<p>Simply switch your language from US to UK English in the International Panel in System Preferences, what is # on the keyboard will now be £.</p>

<p>It annoyed me to no end because I am in UK English most of the time due to spelling differences and suddenly my # character disappeared!</p>

<p>If you enable International language to be shown on the top bar you can switch between your two most used languages with Apple-Spacebar. I switch between Japanese and UK English quite often, and when I need the # key I click US English on the pull-down menu.</p>

<p>Well, alot of good stuff here. I came looking because I couldn't get the `€ symbol on a UK keyboard no matter what I tried. <br>
"stoo" recommends "to get the Euro symbol on a UK keyboard type CTRL-ALT-4 .... €"-------  but that doesn't do it for me.<br>
The way I stumbled upon is (alt ~ 2,) I think that middle one is known as tilde. This assumes your keyboard has the € above the 2 number and next to the @.</p>

<p>In case anybody was wondering where the fraction keys were in OSX, here's a handy way to make your own, in any font.</p>

<p>Open an Appleworks page,  (it's still the coolest word processor and much under-rated.)<br>
Now, type 1/4 into the page, select the /  symbol and press this combination alt shift 1, the / should now look like this  ⁄ .<br>
Next select the 1 and in the Text menu change its style to Superior. All thats left is to select the 4 and change that font size to half the size that all the characters had been originally. Voila, you now have a fraction. <br>
It's possible to do a little extra tweeking by selecting each component and adjusting its size in small steps via the Font / Size / Smaller or Larger dialogue box.  You might like to try this first at a larger font size like 36pt because it can get a bit hard to see.</p>

<p>Not only do Apple Cupertino kidnap the '#' key on UK keyboards but they don't even think us Brits can speak (or read) English!</p>

<p>To whit, the Tab, Shift, Caps Lock, Return, Enter, and Backspace keys all have these funny foreign symbols on them. Whereas the US keyboard has ENGLISH words on them.</p>

<p>A clue to the clueless Americans reading this. The English language was invented in ENGLAND which is part of the UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, and not part of the Eastern USA (that's NEW ENGLAND). This means that we do know how to read English over here.</p>

<p>Those looking for a Mac compatible keyboard which shows the #, €, $, AND £ should look at <a href="http://matias.ca/tactilepro/index.php?refID=7">http://matias.ca/tactilepro/index.php?refID=7</a> it even has ENGLISH words for Shift, Tab, etc.!!</p>

<p>Thanks for the useful info, but I'm using a UK 15" PowerBook that does not have a delete key. Most of the time this is not a problem as the Backspace key usually does the job. The problem arises, however, in Excel when trying to delete more than one cell at a time. Any suggestions? The Delete option in the Edit menu only deletes multiple cells by actually  removing rows and/or columns, which is not always what one wants. So my question is: is there a hidden delete key?

<p>FANTASTIC!</p>

<p>As someone who's also made the move, I'm rather frustrated at the change in keyboard layout.  I've been a touch typist for years and just hate using another layout - especially when the label on the keys are different.  A PC is easy to change,  a Mac is another matter;  until I found this script.</p>

<p>Now, I've a keyboard where the key to the right of the left shift is a backslash &amp; pipe.  The trouble is the Mac refuses to regognise this key and insists I'm typing the key to the left of the enter key.</p>

<p>Anyone any ideas how to use a full 102 key keyboard?</p>

<p>Thankyou.  No,  thankyou *very* much for regaining my sanity!</p>

<p>Oh,  BTW,  how do you get the keyboard to do home to the BOL and end to the EOL.  Those keys seem to not work!</p>

<p>Thanks for this! I had been looking for the # key for ages and got very frustrated!</p>

<p>Speaking of &lt; and &gt;, I was in an Internet cafe in Peru 2 months ago where they had US English keyboard configured with a Spanish layout. Apart from some symbols not being where the keybord said they were, the Spanish international layout assumes you have one extra key left of the right SHIFT key to type &lt; and &gt;. Obviously, the keyboard being US English didn't have that key. It made it very difficult to write any HTML...</p>

<p>Thanks for this post - like others I thought I was going crazy - no # sign!!! <br>
I agree that swapping the " and @ is going to be frustrating but hopefully I'll get used to it quickly.</p>

<p>Another thank you for helping me locate the hash key... was trying to port an app of mine to OS X, and couldn't find the hash key to #include anything with! You'd think they could stick a little # next to the £ on the key itself like they did with the euro. *sigh*</p>
