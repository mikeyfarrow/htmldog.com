	<p>While this web site primarily provides advice on <strong>making</strong> web sites, we thought it might be handy if that was accompanied by advice on <strong>hosting</strong> web sites. So how do you actually get your web site onto the web?</p>

<aside class="note">
<p><img src="../r10/siteground35.png" alt="SiteGround" width="147" height="30">HTML Dog is hosted by <a href="http://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=4960306b51b3ed1ddecbf83b3076ee11">SiteGround</a> and we heartily recommend them. They have provided an exceptionally fast, friendly, and reliable service for this busy site and they are a damned good, value for money option for beginners and experts alike.</p>

<p>We benefit financially from any referrals we send their way so not only can you take advantage of the same service we enjoy (we did our research and we wouldn&#8217;t put this puppy in their care if we weren&#8217;t convinced of their caliber), you can also support this web site at the same time.</p>
</aside>

<h2>How to do it</h2>

<p>The files that make up your site need to sit on a <strong>web server</strong> &#8212; essentially, an always-on computer hardwired to the Internet. Large organizations and ultra-techno nerds have their own servers but most individuals, and even organizations, use a <strong>web hosting company</strong>. They offer space on their professionally maintained web servers for a monthly or annual fee.</p>

<p>Web hosting companies will also enable you to purchase a <strong>domain name</strong>, such as htmldog.com (although not htmldog.com &#8212; it&#8217;s taken &#8212; sorry), often as part of a web hosting package. The domain will then be linked to a folder in your web hosting account, where you will keep all of your web site files.</p>

<aside class="note i">
<p>The most common way to upload your web site to a web hosting account is by using an <strong>FTP client</strong>, such as the free and widely used <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>. FTP stands for <strong>File Transfer Protocol</strong>.</p>

<p>In most cases these small pieces of software are easy to use. In one window you will see the files on your computer. In another you will see the files on your web hosting account (a web host will give you an address and password to log in to your web hosting account). All you have to do is select which files to move over.</p>
</aside>

<aside class="note mag">
<p>If you name an HTML file &#8220;index.html&#8221;, this will serve as the automatic home page of a folder. So, if you have an index.html file in your web site&#8217;s root directory (the folder that your domain name points to), this will show as the home page when you go to, for example, www.yoursite.com.</p>

<h2>Things to consider</h2>

<p>Every web site is unique (well, most of them are, anyway) so before diving in, it is worth considering exactly what you need.</p>

<h3>Web space and bandwidth</h3>

<p>Different web hosting options have different limits in regard to <strong>web space</strong> and <strong>bandwidth</strong>.</p>

<p>Your files will take up space on a server just as they will on your hard disk. And, of course, disk space isn&#8217;t infinite. If you have a web site ready to upload, you can easily see how much space it takes up on your computer, and therefore how much space it will take up on a server. But keep in mind that you might very well want to add to your site in the future. Media such as photographs, video, or audio, are going to take up most space (especially if you don&#8217;t prepare them properly for the web). Also, if you plan on using extra bits and bobs, such as content management systems like WordPress (see later), these will take up space too.</p>

<p>Bandwidth is how much data is downloaded &#8212; how much of your web site is pumped out from a server when visitors come knocking. It isn&#8217;t uncommon for enthusiastic web builders to over-estimate the traffic their web site will attract upon launch (there are quite a few sites out there competing for people&#8217;s attention!). If you find you need more bandwidth as time goes by, most web hosting options will allow you to upgrade at a future date. The same goes for disk space.</p>

<aside class="note i">
<p>You&#8217;ll be doing yourself a massive favor if you <strong>keep your file sizes small</strong> &#8212; they will take up less space on the server, download faster (keeping your visitors happy), and save you bandwidth. One of the most common issues is with <strong>images</strong> &#8212; make sure you optimize them for the web by resizing and compressing them with appropriate software (rather than simply using the huge files that come straight out of your camera, for example).</p>
</aside>

<h3>Features</h3>

<aside class="foodC"><div id="bsap_1305864" class="bsarocks bsap_42de178ce2c5601e0c8eebfd00a854ae"></div></aside>

<p>Fundamentally, you just need somewhere to plonk your HTML and related gubbins. Web hosting companies are increasingly offering additional features, however.</p>

<p>Many web hosting accounts nowadays offer you direct online control over your domain name and email settings as well as access to things such as statistics packages. You also might be given access to server-side languages such as <strong>PHP</strong> or <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> or quickly set up <strong>content management systems</strong> such as WordPress.</p>

<aside class="note five">
<p>A <strong>CMS</strong>, or content management system, allows you to control the design and content of your web site online &#8212; that is, without something like FTP. They often supply you with ready-to-go templates which, while nice and easy, are usually full of junk HTML. Going through <a href="../guides/index.html">a good HTML tutorial</a> will, at the very least, allow you to tinker and improve the code so that it is better suited to your web site.</p>
</aside>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>Not to be underestimated is the importance of <strong>support</strong>. If you get stumped or if something goes wrong you want someone knowledgeable to respond to your queries ASAP.</p>

<aside class="note warning">
<p>There are plenty of shoddy web hosting companies out there and, over the years, we have experienced many. We think we know a thing or three about making web sites but we still find the need for support every now and then. And, again, <a href="http://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=4960306b51b3ed1ddecbf83b3076ee11">SiteGround</a> have not disappointed.</p>
</aside>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>If you Google around you will find a bewildering range of hosting options at vastly different pricing levels, from free to you-need-to-remortgage-your-home-and-sell-a-kidney.</p>

<p>While free packages will invariably suffer in the areas of control, performance, features, and support (not to mention likely slapping advertising all over the place), high-end packages will not necessarily be the best option. If you think about how much space, bandwidth, and features you need, you will probably find you won&#8217;t need to rob a bank.</p>

<aside class="note i">
<p>You might come across the term &#8220;shared hosting&#8221;. This is a good option for beginners. While you can have a server dedicated to your web site, it will cost you. Sharing a server with others makes things more affordable, it is more than adequate for most small to medium sites, and the actual hosting account is still only accessible by you.</p>
</aside>

<h2>Finally&hellip;</h2>

<p>Some other factors to think about involve performance and security. If you opt for a reliable web host with a proven (preferably recommended) track record, you should be OK but these are still things to keep in mind for your darling web site.</p>

<h3>Uptime</h3>

<p><strong>Uptime</strong> is a big deal with servers. If the server stops working, for whatever reason, your web site goes down. Problems occur and maintenance is necessary but a good web host should be able to provide at least 99% uptime.</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> can also be an issue &#8212; you don&#8217;t want a visitor to your web site waiting for everything to load. While much of that is down to you (gigantic images and multimedia spectaculars will slow things down), the performance of a web hosting server can also contribute. And all servers are not created equal.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Servers are prone to malicious attacks in the same way that your computer is prone to a virus or your online bank account is prone to hacking. A good web hosting company will use hardy <strong>security</strong> measures and technology in an attempt to prevent these attacks. Still, take the usual precautions. And don&#8217;t use &#8220;password&#8221; as your password.</p>
